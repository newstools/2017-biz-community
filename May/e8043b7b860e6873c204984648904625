Willow Creek Estate is positioned 26th on the international list of Top 100 Societies or producers of extra virgin olive oil. Two of its products &#x2013; the Directors&#x2019; Reserve as well as the Estate Blend &#x2013; formed part of the 227 extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) that earned bragging rights to Olive Oil of the Year, with the Directors&#x2019; Reserve also included in the Top 100 EVOOs at 73rd place. &#x201c;This ranking is the recognised indicator of quality for olive oil producers over the globe,&#x201d; says Willow Creek Estate brand manager Louise Rabie. &#x201c;We are pleased with our significant rankings and the honour to claim representation for South Africa on the list. It is gratifying for us to see our olive oils receive the recognition that we believe they deserve. The achievement at the EVOO World Ranking is a credit to every individual on the farm who made it possible.&#x201d; International ranking based on multiple awards The importance of every international competition is determined according to the number of participating countries and the number of entries received. In order to be certified as Olive Oil of the Year, a particular extra virgin product must receive multiple awards in a variety of international competitions during a calendar year to score more than the required 160 points &#x2013; the proof of its consistent excellence. In order to claim its position on the international ranking list, Willow Creek&#x2019;s Directors&#x2019; Reserve earned Prestige Gold in both the Terra Olivo and Olivinus competitions, a Gold Medal at Domina IOOC, runner up at L&#x2019;Orciolo D&#x2019;Oro, Special Mention at Sol D&#x2019;Oro and a Silver Medal at the Los Angeles International Olive Oil competition. The olive oil and other products are available at delis and retailers including Woolworths, Checkers, Pick &#x2018;n Pay, Food Lover&#x2019;s Market, Spar, Makro, Game and Montagu Dried Fruit & Nuts. Willow Creek Estate also has a tasting room and shop on the estate, which are open to the public, as well as a nursery that sells olive trees.
