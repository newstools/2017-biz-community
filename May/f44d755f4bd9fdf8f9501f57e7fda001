The Sava Trenta 2 is designed to respond to fleet managers' needs: improving mileage, fuel efficiency and durability - ensuring a long lifespan, lower cost and reliability. The tyre also offers an excellent performance on wet roads for a safety-conscious purchase. Features and benefits: The multi-radius tyre contour generates a long and wide footprint with even pressure distribution between the tyre and road, resulting in high mileage. The solid outside blocks are straight and robust, delivering better force transfer capability compared to its predecessor. This, in turn, offers confident dry handling and braking with heavily loaded vehicles. Strong reinforced edges increase the grip on wet roads, even with a heavily loaded vehicle. The circumferential grooves are at an optimal position to absorb and disperse water out of the tread quickly, resulting in excellent contact on wet roads.
