What does this mean to you personally in terms of your career? I first judged the Loeries in 2013, and feel even more humbled to be picked than I did the first time. I really like the flair and vibe of the Loeries! : Loeries cleans up in AfricaPresenting some of the awards at the 35th Annual Loerie Awards, guest creative director from Hamburg, Gotz Ulmer, was heard to wonder why those receiving prizes were so blas&#233;, so "like Germany" and when they might start behaving "a bit more African"!By Terry Levin 26 Sep 2013 What are you most looking forward to from the 2017 Loeries&#x2019; judging experience? It sounds simple and silly, but just discussing and talking to &#x2018;normal people&#x2019;: creatives. How are you preparing yourself to judge the best work from Africa and the Middle East? By playing African rhythms on my drum kit for two straight days! What are you most looking forward to from the Loeries&#x2019; experience, once the judging is over? Getting as much ideas, talks, fights and inspiration as I can. And the free hugs! This year&#x2019;s Loeries&#x2019; theme is all about &#x2018;judging the work&#x2019; and not your timesheet or other external factors &#x2013; talk about the importance of that, especially in the creative industry. Ideas are the only thing we have. Even though the voices get louder that an idea is 'reaching the right people with the right content', it&#x2019;s not. Be brave and embrace the chaos we call creativity. Let&#x2019;s make it happen! Remember that the Loeries&#x2019; entry deadline has been extended until 31 May. Keep an eye on our Loeries special section for the latest updates.
