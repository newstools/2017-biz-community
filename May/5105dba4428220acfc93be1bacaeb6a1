But, instead of being insulting, he gives his mommy the compliments she deserves. Or does he? You&#x2019;ll have to listen on radio to find out. Briefed to encourage sons and daughters to shop at NetFlorist for Mother&#x2019;s Day, FCB Joburg Creative Director Suhana Gordhan and Copywriter Vusi Khoza tapped Harold&#x2019;s soft spot for a free box of Lindt &#x2018;choccies&#x2019; for those who plan ahead and order their gifts before 10 May. For those who wake up when their coffee is cold, well &#x2026; &#x2018;you snooze, you lose, kittens&#x2019; as Harold would say. The campaign is running on Heart FM, Jacaranda FM, Primedia stations and ECR. It was recorded by Pink Noise @Kwazi Mojo in Bryanston. Click here to listen.
