Willowlamp was commissioned by Australian-based architects Bates Smart to design a series of four chandeliers for The Waiting Room of the Crown Towers Perth. The custom pieces, based on its Mandala No. 1 design, were crafted in their studio in Salt River, Cape Town, and unveiled at the hotel in December 2016. Peer-to-peer voting system The darc awards / decorative was created by international lighting magazines mondoarc and darc to celebrate decorative lighting design projects and products. Using a peer-to-peer voting system, winners were chosen by the international design community who were invited to vote for their favourite projects and products on a specially designed website. The awards received more than 200 entries from 30 countries. &#x201c;The commission for Crown Towers was the largest ever custom design that we have created to date and we are honoured to be acknowledged by members of the global design community for this project,&#x201d; says Adam Hoets, Willowlamp&#x2019;s creative director and founder. &#x201c;We are also excited to see the darc awards / decorative focusing purely on decorative lighting design and look forward to many more years of the competition.&#x201d; View all the winners of the darc awards / decorative.
