We spoke to her this week ahead of her show at GrandWest where she headlines the Divas Cape Town concert on Saturday, 6 May 2017. When are you happiest? The idea of happiness for me is tied to my joy. I don&#x2019;t feel it is possible to be happy without it. Why? Man and outside factors often impact ones&#x2019; happiness; but joy is what you have no matter what is going wrong or right in your life. So, basically I am happiest when the joy that I have is not adversely impacted by &#x201c;stuff&#x201d; that can alter the calm, peace and sanctity of the life I am trying to live. What does music mean to you? Music has always been a safe haven for me. It allows me to escape into a world that is the void of nonsense, things that make no sense, and a rhythm that is all mine in its groove. Music breaks down barriers; marinates in the soul of whoever is willing to hear it; and trust each listener to embrace it without prejudice. Music can speak to you; even when you may not understand the language. Why? It&#x2019;s music and that&#x2019;s what it does, includes everyone no matter where you come from and is the language of the world. Any funny moments on stage? I was performing with Angie Brown of Bizarre, Inc., I&#x2019;m Gonna&#x2019; Get You Baby fame. She and I worked a very successful tour going out as the, Sisters of Soul. It garnered us countless performance awards from around Europe. In the middle of the tour, we did a benefit concert. Well the stage was not quite as big as some of others. We were doing our rendition of Sisters are doing it for themselves. I had no idea that Angie was going to lean on me. Well, she went to lean on me, and I moved towards a corner of the stage. All I know is that I felt her almost slide down my right leg. It was then that I realised that all of her &#x201c;glory&#x201d; was showing to the heavens, and I had to make sure she was okay before I lost it in laughter on the stage. When I say the crowd went wild &#x2013; that would be an understatement. I guess we were so authentic that it caused them to connect even more with us. She and I are still very close to this day! Which living person do you admire most and why? I would have to say that I admire former president, Barack Obama and first lady, Michelle Obama. Why? They personify class, dignity, style, intelligence, magnificence, and grace. All of this while being maintained, while in the faces of people who wanted to destroy their legacy. They represented our country and the people with unadulterated, uncompromised resilience. And when they left the White House we knew that it would not be the same. It&#x2019;s your round, what are you drinking? Vodka and lime cordial would be my drink of choice; or I would have a nice glass of red wine. The song you wished you wrote? Don&#x2019;t Make Me Over (the one Dionne Warwick sung, Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned song) because it is still played heavily and has made the writers a whole lot of money. Written in 1960, yet still heard today. What makes you stand out? Me being me is the best I can offer. If I have to do any more than just be me, then I am not being my authentic and true self, and I most certainly would not stand out. Nicknames? Sybbie, My Syb (Robin S calls me that), Sybs. If you were not a musician what would you do? I would be an educator. Well, actually I am doing that now. I am currently in graduate school and find learning to be fascinating and rewarding. Pick five words to describe yourself? Passionate, thankful, grateful, blessed and creative. 5 Desert Island Discs? Stevie Wonder, Songs In the Key of Life. Loose Ends, Zagora. Frankie Knuckles, Beyond the Tone Arm. Emeli Sande&#x2019; (either one of her two albums). Sounds of Blackness (either one of their first two albums). What song changed your life? You&#x2019;ve Got a Friend. Favourite Fashion Garment? A beautiful pocketbook and great earrings! Give us some real proper slang and what it means: He is a straight busta&#x2019;! It means that is not worth much to you; doesn&#x2019;t have much to offer. Top of your bucket list? Getting my family to South Africa is at the top of my bucket list. I want my mom and dad in particular to visit Table Mountain before they leave this earth. Your greatest achievement: I am not sure if it is my greatest achievement, but I have won two awards this year, that are because of my work outside of the music business. I received a President&#x2019;s Award, and was top 3 in the state of North Carolina from the college system&#x2019;s office as &#x201c;Staff of the Year.&#x201d; I was appointed to oversee a program that I love and that assists college students with addressing their non-academic challenges while trying to matriculate through their course of study Happiness is? Appreciating what you have, not worrying about what you don&#x2019;t, moving with intention, and trusting that which you can&#x2019;t trace&#x2026; because you know who holds the key. On stage I tend to? Escape into the energy of the audience! The best life lesson you have been taught: Live your life on purpose; and never compromise the essence of who you are to appease people who could care less about who you are.
