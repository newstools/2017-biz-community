&#x201c;We are very proud of the innovative and effective work that we were able to produce for the world&#x2019;s number one mayo brand,&#x201d; says co-founder Candice Mullins. &#x201c;To elevate food and mood for Hellmann&#x2019;s and get people sharing on social media, we developed a &#x2018;burger selfie&#x2019; machine that &#x2018;laser toasts&#x2019; actual selfies into the Hellmann&#x2019;s Burger Buns. A proper retro Burger Truck with unique brand experiences like a miniature &#x2018;burger stage&#x2019; for burger portraits and perhaps SA&#x2019;s best burger, added great energy to the launch event and PR campaign.&#x201d; Launch activities included an event on the rooftop at the Neighbourgoods Market and visits to top media houses with the burger truck, serving signature Hellmann&#x2019;s Burgers and capturing key journalists on burger buns! Trending at number one in South Africa on Twitter at launch, key elements from the Hellmann&#x2019;s Rock Your Burger campaign have continued into 2017, with the Burger Selfie Machine and Burger Truck at the heart of a new &#x201c;Hellmann&#x2019;s Burger Route&#x201d; activity. As Mullins summarises, &#x201c;We appreciate the recognition for a campaign that provided a great return for a great campaign launch. We look forward to adding our combination of digital innovation, great experiences, influencer curation and good ol&#x2019; &#x2018;roll up your sleeves&#x2019; PR to do great work for our growing list of blue-chip clients.&#x201d; www.facebook.com/bonfiremediaZA
