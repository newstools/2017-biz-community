zstockphotos 123RF.com &#x201c;Understanding that it might be too much for South Africans to carpool their frequent trips, every day of the week, Carpool Wednesdays encourages regular road users to try sharing a ride with one another, even if it is just for one day a week,&#x201d; says co-founder and product developer, Chris Megan. By downloading the app and finding a match (currently the company is reporting that over 90% of its users find an excellent match &#x2013; meaning less than a 5-minute deviation from normal routing), car-poolers can share the cost of the journey. Payments are settled via the app, negating the need for sometimes, uncomfortable conversations around money. The added benefit of using the app is that uGoMyWay has also committed to planting trees every month. For every car removed from the road, the time it takes to travel to the destination is reduced (just think school holidays and how free the roads are when there are fewer cars around). To top it all off, there are environmental pluses too; a reduction of cars reduces emissions. Download the app from either the Google Playstore or Apple iTunes, log a trip, find a match, chat securely, exchange details, agree on a cost per kilometre (uGoMyway recommends R1) and carpool. It is as simple as that. The company is encouraging car-poolers to take a selfie with their fellow car-poolers and post and tag uGoMyWay on the image on both Facebook and Instagram @uGoMyWay with the hashtag #CarpoolWednesdays.
