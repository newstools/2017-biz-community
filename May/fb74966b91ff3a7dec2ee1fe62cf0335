Hein Swart, MD of Mitchell&#x2019;s Brewery says, &#x201c;The first beer I ever tasted was from Mitchell&#x2019;s when I was on holiday in Knysna as a young man, long before craft beer was even a thing.&#x201d; He joined South African Breweries and achieved the hard-earned status of SAB Master. &#x201c;It has given me the experience, knowledge and know-how to take a brand such as Mitchell&#x2019;s, which has a craft brewing history of more than thirty years, and drive it forward commercially." Investing in quality Apart from the new packaging design, there has also been investment in optimising quality, consistency and production processes at the sub-20,000 hlpa brewery. Filtration and pasteurisation capabilities have been implemented and a fermentation tank farm extended, with additional fermentation vessels to ensure reliable supply. International brew-master, J rg Finkeldey, who consults to the production team at Mitchell&#x2019;s says, &#x201c;The range continues to remain true to original ingredients and we are constantly refining processes to ensure the best brew across our entire range.&#x201d; The ability to source high-quality ingredients locally remains core to the brewery's philosophy. &#x201c;We are in the prime Southern Cape agricultural region, where hops are cultivated, so we have access to the finest raw ingredients on our doorstep. We only use 100% natural ingredients, which are locally sourced, using original recipes and a unique brewing process, resulting in full-bodied, thirst-quenching flavours for our discerning clientele,&#x201d; says Finkeldey. There is a permanent staff complement, which has been at the brewery for the past 15-18 years and is nurtured in the skill of craft beer production. &#x201c;Getting craft beer right is part science and part art; it takes a high-level of commitment from everyone at the brewery, and we&#x2019;re very fortunate to have such a long-standing and dedicated team of people involved from the local community,&#x201d; concludes Swart.
