Kamstrup s smart water metering solutionsThe accuracy and broad range of Kamstrup&#x2019;s smart water metering solutions are attracting significant interest from municipalities, utilities, and environmental agencies in South Africa. According to Frost & Sullivan, the company has continuously nurtured and enhanced the value of its products to offer customers advanced solutions for a low total cost of ownership. Optimising operations &#x201c;Kamstrup&#x2019;s smart water metering solutions combine the newest ultrasonic technology with remote reading, advanced pressure, and leakage surveillance to allow utilities to control their water distribution systems in previously impossible ways,&#x201d; said Frost & Sullivan research analyst Nikhil Deshbhratar. &#x201c;The improved solution helps users monitor temperature, pressure, water quality, and water loss in the distribution network. The superior data quality, consistency, and remote system configuration capability go a long way in helping utilities make real-time decisions and optimise operations.&#x201d; Additionally, the most outstanding feature of Kamstrup&#x2019;s meters&#x2019; is their ability to retrieve data with the help of drive-by, walk-by or fixed infrastructure technology. The technology neither relies on end users to read the meter, nor requires them to send the consumption data. When utilities need to collect meter data, they merely have to drive near the meter&#x2019;s location. The data is automatically collected and transferred to the meter data management system. More comprehensive data The data collected from Kamstrup&#x2019;s systems are more comprehensive than the data from any other type of meter. It contains information about leaks and bursts, as well as the highest water flow rates, enabling customers to understand their water consumption levels and patterns and prepare for the future. &#x201c;Kamstrup&#x2019;s two modular, multi-communication smart water meters &#x2014; the MULTICAL 21 and flowIQ 3100 &#x2014; are aimed at the residential and industrial segments, respectively. They are static water meters and do not have any moving or mechanical parts, which translates to lower maintenance and total costs of ownership,&#x201d; noted Deshbhratar. &#x201c;They use ultrasonic signals to calculate the time difference between the upstream and downstream movement of signals, which is then used for calculating volume and flow rate.&#x201d; Kamstrup&#x2019;s meters maintain high precision throughout their lifetimes, even if the flowrate falls. Furthermore, its meters were tested and approved by the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) in 2013, resulting in a huge boost to saleability.
