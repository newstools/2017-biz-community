"We know that face-to-face meetings are crucial to business success. Research has shown they boost profitability. With Blu Planet for Meetings, we help our guests have successful experience meetings and help protect our environment by reducing their overall carbon footprint," says Huijbrechts. Committed to water sustainability All sustainable companies calculate and report their company&#x2019;s carbon footprint based on their own energy consumption, purchased energy and their supply chain footprint, which includes business travel. For each meeting or event held at a Radisson Blu hotel, the carbon footprint will be calculated and offset through Gold Standard carbon offsetting projects in Guatemala, Malawi, and India, linked to water sustainability. The selected First Climate carbon offsetting projects contribute to fighting global warming and support the UN Sustainable Development Goals. &#x201c;Water sustainability is an important commitment from Radisson Blu, and we are delighted to partner with First Climate on dedicated water projects that will have a positive impact on communities as we help provide safe drinking water,&#x201d; says Huijbrechts.
