Nelson Mandela Day commemorates the lifetime of service Nelson Mandela gave to South Africa and the world and it calls on us all, every day, to make the world a better place. &#x201c;More than 63% of South African children live in poverty; one in five &#x2013; 12-million &#x2013; South Africans live in extreme poverty. Our intention is to eradicate poverty from the face of the earth. We have to be that bold,&#x201d; said the Nelson Mandela Foundation&#x2019;s director of communication and outreach, Luzuko Koti on the first announcement of the theme &#x2018;Action Against Poverty&#x2019;. Pride and patriotism Brand South Africa&#x2019;s long-standing relationship with the Nelson Mandela Foundation has resulted in a partnership that focuses on primary flagship projects that contribute towards improving the lives of all citizens and communities. Thoko Modise, Brand South Africa&#x2019;s strategic relationship manager: civil society, says, &#x201c;Brand South Africa is pleased to continue its relationship with the foundation. We strive to reiterate the words of Nelson Mandela continuously, to create a better world for all who live in it and to encourage everyone to play their part. As the custodian of the nation&#x2019;s brand, we have a responsibility to drive pride and patriotism amongst South Africans to take care of one another, whilst contributing to the National Development Plan.&#x201d; &#x201c;What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.&#x201d; &#x2013; Nelson Mandela
