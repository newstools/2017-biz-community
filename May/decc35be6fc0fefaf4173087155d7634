When the time came to promote Jet&#x2019;s new range of baby clothing, the brand wanted to show moms that Jet "gets them", by having a little fun and treating them to a campaign that gives them a little &#x2018;me time&#x2019; moment to enjoy. &#x201c;Our brand ethos is to understand our customers&#x2019; needs, so the idea behind this baby campaign was to show that we get how hard motherhood is. We not only want to provide moms with quality products at great prices but also give them a moment of entertainment and support too,&#x201d; says Jerry Anthonyrajah, marketing & strategy executive at Edcon. Joe Public says it created a campaign that allows moms to indulge in a rare moment off, while showing them the products Jet has for their little one this winter. "The #JetGetsMoms campaign puts a fresh spin on how clothing retailers market their baby ranges and was devised with the main objective of giving moms a shopping experience that they can really, really enjoy." The television commercial was realised by award-winning director Marc Sidelsky from Bouffant, with a cute, yet challenging cast of eight superstar babies and one handsome Fezile Mkhize to work with. Mkhize, the main man in the campaign, considered himself part of the crew and shared his experience of the shoot. &#x201c;It has been awesome. Everybody on set is amazing &#x2013; it has just been a good vibe. [The babies] are absolute pros, and I loved every second.&#x201d; TV AD: This new @jet_fashion tv commercial ... &#xfffd;&#xfffd;... errr... ahem...
