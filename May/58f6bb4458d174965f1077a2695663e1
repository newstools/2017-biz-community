Anantara Spa hydrotherapy poolThe humble bath gets a modern revival One of the world&#x2019;s oldest spa remedies is still a firm favourite among world-weary travellers. In spas around the world, the humble bath is being reborn as a luxuriant rite of passage, a time-honoured ritual of water, scent, and nourishing ingredients to help soothe away the stresses of the day. Natural minerals More and more, world-class spas are beginning to recognise a beauty secret that many cultures have known for millennia &#x2013; some of the best ingredients can be found directly underfoot. From soaking in a scented salt-bath to being completely enveloped in a heavenly and detoxifying clay Rhassoul, mineral elements in their natural state are taking centre stage for their ability to pamper and re-beautify dull, lifeless skin. Sleep wellness The fatigue inherent in modern living takes a toll we are all too familiar with, and nothing rejuvenates body and mind like a truly deep sleep. Top international spas know this and are increasingly shifting sleep-focused treatments out of the spa and into the privacy of the guest room, all in the interest of a truly good night&#x2019;s sleep. Anantara Spa&#x2019;s in-villa Slumber Guru Experience, for example, combines the relaxative properties of a scented bath, calming back, neck and shoulder massage, exotic warm beverages and soothing music to ensure guests wake up truly refreshed and relaxed. A blend of influences A Thai massage flows seamlessly into a traditional North African clay Rhassoul. Ancient elixirs line shelves alongside the world&#x2019;s most advanced skincare products. The days of exclusively themed spa experiences are over, giving way to a holistic, &#x201c;best-of-both-worlds&#x201d; approach to beauty and wellness. Today&#x2019;s spa guests want what they want when they want it, and new levels of wellness eclecticism are emerging in order to give it to them.
