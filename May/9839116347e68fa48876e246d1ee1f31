The film tells the story of a cardiac surgeon, Dr Lisa Cooper (Natalie Becker-Aakervik), who saves lives on her operating table every day, but is absolutely powerless when it comes to saving the life of her only son, Sam. Her son&#x2019;s chances of getting a liver transplant are overwhelmingly stacked against him. When the final hope of receiving a transplant is severed, Lisa decides to bypass the institutionalised medical system. Her decision leads her right into the heart of conspiracy, danger and an international organ trafficking syndicate. When asked about the story, Director Shane Vermooten says that the controlling idea of Bypass is that every life is of equal value. Lisa&#x2019;s journey takes her on a path where that belief becomes very difficult to hold onto, especially when it is pinned up against the need to save her own son. Writer/Producer Diane Vermooten goes on to say: &#x201c;We wanted to capture the dynamics of what goes on in a mother's heart when the decision she makes could mean the life or death of her child. We asked so many mothers what they would do if they had the choice to save the life of their child, and most said that they would do whatever it takes.&#x201d; As Becker explains: &#x201c;The things we believe when we are far removed from a situation are often challenged when we find ourselves confronted with the issue. Very often we may surprise ourselves with the decisions we make.&#x201d; 10% of profits to the Organ Donor Foundation From the outset the team behind Bypass wanted to craft a story that creates social awareness and makes a lasting impression. This was fuelled by the realisation that there aren&#x2019;t enough stories being told around the issue of organ trafficking. Actor Deon Lotz, who portrays Dr Wright, one of the surgeons at the clinic, adds: &#x201c;Besides the sex trade and drug trafficking, organ trafficking is one of the biggest problems that we currently face in the world. I am surprised that more movies aren&#x2019;t made about it.&#x201d; Perhaps one of the most poignant messages comes from actor Greg Kriek, who plays Martin Fischer: &#x201c;Bypass is not just another movie - it gives you a slice of life and exposes the underbelly of an issue that is happening right under our noses.&#x201d; If 90 minutes of thrilling entertainment isn&#x2019;t enough to get you out of the house and into cinemas, then an added motivation is the fact that the team behind Bypass will give 10% of the profits made in cinemas to the Organ Donor Foundation.
