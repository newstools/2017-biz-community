The agency was awarded a Clio for its Coca-Cola campaign, #ThatsGold @SuperSportTV, in the Partnerships, Sponsorships & Endorsements category. The campaign entailed creating a series of commercials around the 2016 Olympic Games where fans determined the content of the commercials through social media conversation. The commercials were created to uplift South African fans and allow them to celebrate their golden moments around the Olympic Games. The campaign culminated in a two-minute theme piece which featured all the South African medal moments. Playmakers CEO Richard Dunn, &#x201c;We are immensely proud of this achievement to be recognised on the global stage. Coca-Cola have recently given us the opportunity to lead on Global Charters and to go out and win an award on the global stage like the Clio is massively rewarding not only for Playmakers but the team at Coca-Cola South Africa.&#x201d; Dunn credits not only the client and the agency in the success but also the part that DSTV Media Sales & SuperSport played in producing the campaign. &#x201c;We challenged convention in the broadcast media space with this campaign and this came with lots of challenges. This could not have been achieved without working with our partners. We have produced a globally ground breaking approach to broadcast media which has also been recognised by the International Olympic Committee as the best use of broadcast rights by a sponsor at last year&#x2019;s Olympic Games.&#x201d; Coca-Cola&#x2019;s Connections Planning Manager Jodie Bailey-Norris, &#x201c;Playmakers have always seen the sponsorship media world a little differently to everyone else, they are continually trying to set the benchmark and we are delighted with the success from this campaign.&#x201d; Dunn is optimistic that this recognition will lead to new opportunities going forward for his team. &#x201c;The sponsorship and media industries are continually re-inventing themselves and we believe this award with will kick start a new approach to the way we move forward in the media industry.&#x201d; The international Clio Sports Awards were launched in 2014 with an aim to honour the best in sports advertising and marketing.
