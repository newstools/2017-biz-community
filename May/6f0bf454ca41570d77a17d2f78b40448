 Dmitriy Shpilko 123RF.com#HBR will be broadcast via podcasts on its website and available for download via iTunes, or your favourite podcasting software. &#x201c;Podcasting in South Africa is growing fast, and providing listeners with a wide range of niche options beyond the limits of commercial radio,&#x201d; says Dean of Henley Business School Africa, Jon Foster-Pedley. &#x201c;Internationally, some of the best journalism and entertainment in the world is being produced in podcasts such as Radio Lab, Freakonomics Radio, Serial and so on, and we believe that Henley is uniquely positioned as a business school to offer interesting and entertaining angles on subjects that will delight as well as inform.&#x201d; The first podcast from #HBR, #WhatsTrending, will be a topical look at important issues of the week. Hosted by Foster-Pedley, #WhatsTrending will offer listeners the opportunity to develop a comprehensive, 360 view of what is going on in the world, and will feature analysis from top leaders across the fields of business, education, arts, culture, and science as guests. The second weekly podcast is #AskAnExpert. This will tie-in with regular breakfast discussions such as the Africa Series and Leaders for a Future World, which are held at Henley&#x2019;s Sunninghill, Johannesburg campus. Speakers at previous events include comedian John Vlismas and entrepreneur Stafford Masie. Listeners will be encouraged to submit questions to experts via social media which will be answered during the podcast. &#x201c;Through #HBR and our associated social media channels, we want to encourage intelligent and vibrant debates around important topics,&#x201d; says Foster-Pedley, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be aiming to explore all angles around a theme, from the frivolous to the deadly serious, and work with our listeners to achieve new insights.&#x201d; The podcasts will be produced by Gareth Armstrong, who also produces the Future CEOs podcast, which is currently the second most popular feature show on CliffCentral.com. &#x201c;Our goal fits to establish Henley as the place to go to for thought leadership on any subject, not just those you might associate with a traditional business school,&#x201d; Armstrong says, &#x201c;We really want to engage people, to educate, inform and entertain.&#x201d; The launch of this digital radio is a first for Henley Business School Africa.
