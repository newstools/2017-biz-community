 Santa Maria 123RF.com"The PPG proposal undervalues AkzoNobel, contains significant risks and uncertainties, makes no substantive commitments to stakeholders and demonstrates a lack of cultural understanding," chief executive Ton Buchner in a statement. The Amsterdam-based AkzoNobel, which makes household brands such as Dulux and Trimetal, was responding to a revised offer from PPG late last month which valued the Dutch company at about &#x20ac;24.6bn ($27bn). PPG warned its third offer on 24 April was "one last invitation" to AkzoNobel to "engage with us on creating extraordinary value and benefits for all of AkzoNobel's stakeholders". It offered to buy all shares in the Dutch company at some 96.75 euros per share, an increase of 6.75 euros on a previous bid on March 21. That would have increased the value of the company from some &#x20ac;22.4bn to &#x20ac;24.6bn. But AkzoNobel's senior management remained unmoved Monday, saying the group "concluded that PPG's proposal is not in the best interests of the company, its shareholders and all other stakeholders". CEO Buchner reiterated that AkzoNobel "has outlined a compelling strategy to accelerate growth and value creation which we believe will deliver significant long-term value". The strategy included plans to shed its specialist chemicals division and comes after it was buoyed by stronger-than-expected 2017 first quarter profits. But AkzoNobel, often seen as a broad barometer for underlying global economic activity, has been under pressure in the increasingly hostile battle with the Pittsburg-based PPG. Last week, ratings agency Standard & Poor's announced it was placing AkzoNobel on "CreditWatch with negative implications" due to "the uncertainty around the policy choices currently available to Akzo regarding future ownership, leverage, and strategic direction".
