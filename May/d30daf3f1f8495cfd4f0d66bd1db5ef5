Upping the tempo and grabbing attention by featuring the energetic tune made famous in 1958 by Mexican-American musician Ritchie Valens, &#x2018;La Bamba&#x2019;, the commercial nevertheless has true South Africa appeal as it replaces the word &#x2018;La Bamba&#x2019; with &#x2018;Lambile&#x2019;, which is Zulu for &#x2018;hungry&#x2019;. Just 30-seconds long, it urges all South Africans to beat their hunger with Debonairs Pizza&#x2019;s latest &#x2018;Real Deal for a steal&#x2019; - a choice of one of three delicious &#x2018;lamba busters&#x2019; for only R21.90. The concept was devised by FCB Creative Director Greg Cameron, Art Director Mpumi Ngwenya and Copywriter Mbeu Kambuwa, and the ad recorded in Bryanston at Rob Roy Music. The ad is the first in a series of &#x2018;Lambile&#x2019; ads that will roll out over the course of the rest of year. Keep an ear open.
