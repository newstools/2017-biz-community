In stock form the M2 makes a useful 272kW and 465Nm and BMW claim a 4.5 zero to 100km/h sprint &#x2013; dropping to 4.3 with the optional double-clutch 7-speed &#x2018;box. Those numbers would&#x2019;ve likely been achieved with the overboost function, which unleashes a burst of 500Nm. As impressive as is from the factory, an RGM customer wanted his BMW M2 to really stand out from the performance crowd. In this instance, the customer opted for a Techniflow de-cat exhaust downpipe and plug-in power software (PPS), a combination which has seen the M2 morph into a 300kW/580Nm beastie.
