Announcing the campaign, Patrick Kulati, Habitat for Humanity SA&#x2019;s national director said, &#x201c;67 homes for 67 families will be built during Habitat&#x2019;s Build Week with the help of active citizens. We need the help of South African corporate teams to come together from across all sectors not only to help build the homes but also to use their financial resources to help build the community of Orange Farm beyond the construction of the homes.&#x201d; For more information, go to www.habitat.org.za.
