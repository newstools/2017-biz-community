Owner of the StevenBe design, fibre and yarn shop in Minneapolis, Berg is a former corporate designer whose resume includes Munsingwear, Perry Ellis and Versace. He combines his passion for knitting with his eye for design. In 2003, Berg opened the Yarn Garage in Rosemount with his sister and the large shop with a full-service yarn, knitting and needlework station became a destination for enthusiasts. Just over a year ago, StevenBe branched out, opening his South Minneapolis shop named after his design line. The new space has allowed him to expand his reach in the knitting, crocheting and needlework world.
