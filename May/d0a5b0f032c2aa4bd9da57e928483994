The day is a global response bringing together non-profits, government agencies, the private sector, the media and individuals to promote menstrual hygiene management. In so doing, World Menstrual Hygiene Day assists in breaking the silence and builds awareness about the fundamental role that good menstrual hygiene management plays in enabling women and girls to reach their full potential. &#x201c;Mimi Women was founded on the premise that menstruation shouldn&#x2019;t result in absences, nor should it result in girls missing out on their right to an education and an opportunity for a career,&#x201d; says CEO Ramona Kasavan. &#x201c;So, we set out to find a sustainable solution to the challenge and are pleased that today we can boldly say that through donations and sponsorships we are able to keep 32,500 girls, living across nine provinces, within three African countries, in school without fear of being ridiculed and embarrassed because of their menstruation.&#x201d; Average school days lost It is estimated that because of the lack of affordable sanitary pads, thousands of South African girls lose an average of 60 days, which equates to 20%, of the school calendar year. This means that over a 12-year schooling career, girls can lose up to 528 days of school. Alternatively, school going girls are often forced to use old rags as a substitute pad or entertain a &#x2018;blesser&#x2019; to avoid missing school due to their monthly period. The eventuality is that too often girls are forced to drop out of school because of shame or because they&#x2019;ve fallen irretrievably behind with their work. &#x201c;Working together, we can do more to ensure that these young women, who are our future leaders, retain their dignity and look forward to a brighter future. For a donation of just R180 for an entire year per girl, there should be no reason for girls to miss out on school because of their period,&#x201d; says Kasavan
