Retail sales jumped 6.3% last month compared with a year earlier, according to a joint survey from the British Retail Consortium (brC) and financial group KPMG. Easter fell in April this year, but in March in 2016. "April's sales provided a brief period of respite for retailers following a relentless start to the year," said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG. "However, much of the rise was driven by the timing of Easter and the growing inflationary pressures the sector is facing, rather than a sudden upswing in consumer confidence." Source: AFP
