&#x201c;At DStv, we&#x2019;re always looking for ways to excite and engage our customers. It&#x2019;s all about creating real-time experiences that are fun and engaging; and DStv Delicious does just that! Food channels come to life; kids get to interact with their favourite characters and much-loved celebrities mingle with our valued customers&#x201d; commented Nomsa Chabeli general manager for marketing at DStv. Highlight of the gastronomical year &#x201c;This year our aim is to surpass the success of 2016, which itself enjoyed exceptional public support due to the world-class quality of the international and local acts, the high standard of local chefs, the enticing gourmet food market and the hugely popular Kids Zone&#x201d; says Lloyd Cornwall, Festival Director of the DStv Delicious Festival. &#x201c;The festival is a highlight of the gastronomical year due to its eclectic entertainment and fusions of foods that please all tastes, whether traditional or contemporary.&#x201d; &#x201c;The growth of satisfied festival patrons is testament to our unique recipe. The main components of its success are: international and local artists, international and local chefs featured in various pop-up restaurants and cooking theatres, channel activations, brand activations, an interactive kids zone, South Africa&#x2019;s biggest gourmet street food market, and a world class dance arena.&#x201d; The line-up announcements will be made later in the year.
