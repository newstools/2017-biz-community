&#x201c;In order to demonstrate how users can experience a view that is wider than before, we have teamed up with Twitter, through our relationship with Ad Dynamo, offering consumers the opportunity to experience true 360-degree video. Similar to the recently launched Galaxy S8 with Infinity Display, 360-degree video on Twitter challenges the norm,&#x201d; says Craige Fleischer, director of integrated mobility at Samsung South Africa. Samsung chose Muizenberg, the Umhlanga Lighthouse, the Johannesburg CBD, Nelson Mandela Bridge, Table Mountain and the Union Buildings. According to Fleischer, 360-degree videos are becoming a very popular way of delivering content, thanks to innovations like the Gear 360 camera and Gear VR and, most recently, Galaxy S8. Samsung is also giving away a Galaxy S8 to one lucky winner. To enter, view the 360-degree videos on the @SamsungMobileSA Twitter feed, and retweet to vote for your favourite landmark. One winner will be selected per region.
