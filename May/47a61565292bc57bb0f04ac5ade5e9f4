It is here that the Standard Bank Young Artist for Jazz makes their big debut performance. This year&#x2019;s winner, bassist Benjamin Jephta, will be following in the footsteps of successful alumni that include Gloria Bosman, Victor Ntoni, Sibongile Khumalo, Siya Makuzeni, Kesivan Naidoo, Melanie Scholtz, Kyle Shepherd, Bokani Dyer and many more. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re serious about music and jazz, and want an experience that will live with you for a lifetime then put it on your bucket list and come to Jazztown this year,&#x201d; says Hazel Chimhandamba, Head: Group Sponsorships for Standard Bank who have supported the festival for 20 years.
