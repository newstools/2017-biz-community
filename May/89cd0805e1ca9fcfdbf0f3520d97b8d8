Contestants were challenged to create a 60-second commercial for UNICEF South Africa that addressed the issue of cyber-bullying. The catch? They had 48-hours to conceptualise and produce a commercial ready for screening in Ster-Kinekor cinemas. Their commercial, which is viewable here, depicts a group chat on a mobile phone. The messenger features a &#x2018;built-in-conscience&#x2019;, which requires the sender to answer a multitude of questions prior to their message being sent. Appealing to their conscience, the sender ultimately decides against sending a nasty message about a peer. &#x201c;While bullying of students has always been an issue, it has been exacerbated by social media. A seemingly harmless action can inflict great damage, and we wanted to highlight this by imagining a messaging feature that prompts the user to think twice before sending something hurtful,&#x201d; explains Botha. Says Coetzee, &#x201c;Pulling together a concept and producing a cinema-ready commercial within two days of briefing was no easy feat, but it was an exciting challenge and we are incredibly honoured and humbled to have made it this far.&#x201d; The duo will compete against other finalists from across the world for the title of &#x2018;Young Lions of Cannes 2017&#x2019;, in the &#x2018;Film&#x2019; category. The teams will, once again, have 48 hours to complete their challenge for a non-profit organisation. Krige van Rensburg, deputy creative director at 99c, says, &#x201c;Having two of our colleagues represent their country at the world&#x2019;s most prestigious creativity awards speaks volumes about the talent we have at 99c. &#x201c;We are incredibly proud of Amri and Carina, and we will be cheering them on every step of the way!&#x201d;
