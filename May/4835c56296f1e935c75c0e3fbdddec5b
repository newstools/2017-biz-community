OLC's brand-new offices in SandtonIn 2017, OLC pitched on seven new businesses and is thrilled to announce that they have steadily clinched every single account! New clients in the OLC stable include Fortune 500 firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG), JSE-listed pharmaceutical giant Adcock Ingram, MSD's Bravetco, Plumblink and most recently, iconic chocolate manufacturer Ferrero Rocher. OLC has also successfully repitched automotive giant KIA as well as telecommunications multinational Huawei. In addition to this, OLC has been successfully collaborating with online video-on-demand heavyweight Showmax on some exciting projects.

We are excited and motivated; 2017- so far, so good,&#x201d; commented OLC MD Jerome Cohen.
