This is the story of a man who showed the world where humble beginnings could lead. Starting out with nothing, McLaren built an empire that changed the world of motor racing. An artist and a man who had the ability to think big, he was a leader who went from success to success. The movie is a mix of interviews with McLaren's colleagues, family, friends and rivals, sourced archive footage and live action reconstruction. "I think there are comparisons to be drawn between Bruce and stars like James Dean and Buddy Holly &#x2013; incredibly talented young people who never lived to realise their true potential," says Donaldson. "Bruce was only 32 when he died, yet in that short period of time he achieved an enormous amount and built an incredible reputation for himself and the company. I think his life had everything that you look for in a great story &#x2013; and Bruce&#x2019;s legacy will live on through this film." McLaren will be released on Blu-ray, DVD and digital platforms on 29 May 2017. For global release information visit www.mclarenfilm.com.
