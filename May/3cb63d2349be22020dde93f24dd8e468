According to Danny Bryer, the area director sales for Protea Hotels by Marriott, &#x201c;In a node of increasing significance such as Centurion, all effort must be made to build on what is already successful, consistently adding value so that visitors will enjoy the hospitality they&#x2019;ve come to expect on an ongoing basis. This part of Pretoria has always been a sought-after suburb for both business and residential reasons, being conveniently situated close to commercial and lifestyle centres.&#x201d; &#x201c;This hotel has many aspects of charm to it; it&#x2019;s a favourite with our many regular visitors who enjoy its close proximity to many places of interest for leisure activities and to the commercial district. With that in mind, we&#x2019;re conscious of the need to refresh what&#x2019;s on offer to build onto a successful foundation so that we can welcome even more guests to enjoy what&#x2019;s on offer,&#x201d; comments Etienne Potgieter, general manager of Protea Hotel by Marriott Pretoria Centurion. To minimise disruptions to regular guests, the renovation process will be carried out in a staggered approach that will allow the hotel to stay open. The renovation will be done in various phases, between 9am and 4pm on weekdays, with sections of the hotel being closed completely during this process, which takes place between 22 April and 26 August 2017.
