Introduced in 2015, the campaign in which Builders has partnered with SuperSport to construct sports fields around South African communities, targets schools that are excelling in sports without adequate sporting facilities. Since 2015, Builders and SuperSport have constructed six sports fields in various school across South Africa. Tekwane Primary School was the first school in 2017 to receive the sports field. To mark the celebration of the new sports field, 10 schools participated in the Builders soccer tournament. The tournament aims to bring schools and communities together to benefit from new facilities and contribute to soccer development as well as offer children a platform to showcase their talents. League created &#x201c;This tournament was created to allow the schools around the community an opportunity to experience the new facilities as well as contribute to the love of soccer. In doing so we also created a sustainable league that includes the under-10 and under-12 age groups. It is so humbling to see what a success it has been, and to watch children united by sport is extraordinary,&#x201d; said Andre Steyn, Builders marketing and innovations director. Participating schools also received physical education training from Active Education coaches, who paid a weekly visit to each school on an on-going bases. Active Education holds a partnership agreement with the Department of Basic Education, which allows them access to the schools and the local district office.
