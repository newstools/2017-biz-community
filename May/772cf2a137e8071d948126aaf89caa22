2017 marks the 61st anniversary of the Women&#x2019;s March and August in South Africa has evolved into the month dedicated to all matters feminine. As media mogul Moyin Oloruntoba commented during last year&#x2019;s Women's Month interview with Biz&#x2019;s Ruth Cooper: &#x201c;Womens&#x2019; Month is not important if it means we only pay attention to women&#x2019;s issues for 31 days of the year.&#x201d; We couldn&#x2019;t have put it better, which is why we dedicate not only the whole month, but also the entire year to the awesome women that shape our industries. Last year Bizcommunity showcased nearly 100 women achievers and influencers including entrepreneurs such as Ntombenhle Khathwane, TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris ECD Jenny Glover, digital doyenne Natasha Fourie and more across 18 industries from marketing, media and digital to automotive, healthcare, finance, CSI and more. Recognising Top Women of 2017&lt;!&gt; A highlight of Women's Month coverage this year will be the media partnership with the Standard Bank Top Woman Awards, a glittering event recognising female achievers within both the private and public sectors. So not only will August offer a comprehensive expos of what women have achieved in the past year within our African business communities, but also showcase exclusive individuals, issues, content and social media activity associated with this prestigious event. In South Africa it all started with the Women&#x2019;s March to the Union Buildings back in 1956, when an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 women marched from across the country to Pretoria to hand over thousands of petitions protesting the pass laws. 60,5% of Bizcommunity&#x2019;s 464,000 readership are women, but Women's Month content is certainly not relevant exclusively to women!
