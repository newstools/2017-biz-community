James Moffatt Verushen Reddy&#x201c;Our goal since inception 12 years ago has always been to innovate and offer a range of services that best serves each client,&#x201d; says James Moffatt, Promise CEO. &#x201c;The most recent client to join our stable of well-known brands is Rand Merchant Bank (RMB), a financial powerhouse that we are very proud to be servicing in a through-the-line capacity across its entire portfolio.&#x201d; Preceding RMB at the start of the last financial year was Edcon Specialty, the division that houses Edgars Active, CNA, Boardmans, Red Square and Edcon Cellular; as well as its international brands portfolio that comprises iconic brands like Calvin Klein and Lipsy, Moffatt says. Promise was also successful in its through-the-line pitch for Castle Lager, and has secured responsibility for the entire digital marketing portfolio for long-standing client, AfriSam. Says Verushen Reddy, Director, Strategy & Innovation: &#x201c;To continue innovating and charting new paths in our business, we have introduced a full-service data offering to assist clients to unlock the potential of their data, for both planning and ongoing optimisation. We believe this is a unique offering in the independent agency space.&#x201d; Reddy adds that working with clients&#x2019; data to improve marketing and advertising while identifying opportunities for alternative revenue streams and business improvement is a key growth area for Promise, and one that is attracting interest from existing and potential clients. &#x201c;This approach towards the generation of insights and creative inspiration has already started to benefit a large portion of our clients,&#x201d; he says. Moffatt adds that Promise&#x2019;s strategy has always been &#x201c;to be remarkable, grow our services through diversification, but stay true to our core values&#x201d;. This includes having an intimate knowledge of the business each client does and the sectors they function in, and continually seeking creative solutions and opportunities on their behalf. &#x201c;All effective innovation is grounded in data,&#x201d; Reddy adds, &#x201c;and our new data offering also brings the prospect of seeing where there is room for disruption, or to avoid being disrupted.&#x201d; With a team that has grown from two people 12 years ago to 90 staff members now, diversification has allowed Promise to reduce client production costs and make use of under-one-roof services that give both the client and the account executives far better control over campaigns and saving time. &#x201c;We have always promised our clients &#x2018;remarkable&#x2019;, and always delivered that &#x2013; along with value, ethical business dealings and meticulous crafting of creative solutions,&#x201d; Moffatt says. &#x201c;Our track record speaks for itself, but we are also aware that resting on our laurels has no place in our clients&#x2019; businesses. Seeking solutions is our passion and one that we have built into the cornerstone of our client relationships.&#x201d;
