The ad introduces Toyota fans to Hilux&#x2019;s new tone of voice and sets it up as the vehicle for those who can handle anything &#x2013; from navigating challenging terrain to impressing their future father-in-law. Nobel laureate, Rudyard Kipling, provided the inspiration for the FCB Joburg team tasked with curating the brand&#x2019;s evolution. &#x201c;Toyota Hilux is and always has been a much-admired South African brand. People love it for its rugged, outdoor capabilities and tough attitude,&#x201d; said Chief Creative Officer Brett Morris, who crafted the piece together with Creative Director Tian Van den Heever, Copywriter Tracy-Lynn King and Art Director Georja Romano. &#x201c;But, not everyone is fully aware of its more sophisticated side. The latest Hilux is a top-quality, reliable and innovative vehicle with a rich heritage. Not to mention its serious good looks. &#x201c;Kipling&#x2019;s poem &#x2018;If&#x2019; is a well-recognised and inspiring form of paternal advice in which Kipling tells his son about what it takes to be a man. &#x201c;As the brand that claims to be &#x2018;tougher-er&#x2019;, the Hilux creative team looked at re-interpreting this classic piece of literature and sharing an entertaining story about what it really means to be a tough guy in today&#x2019;s modern world,&#x201d; he said. The commercial was directed by Adrian Garces of Velocity Films, and launched on television on 7 May. There is also a cinema version and online versions.
