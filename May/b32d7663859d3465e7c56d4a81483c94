&#x201c;We started out with Salt & Pepper, then added Braai Salt, Flame Grilled Barbeque Seasoning, Garlic & Herb and Salt and Vinegar,&#x201d; says Jackie Nkadimeng, Cerebos marketing manager. &#x201c;Now we have come up with three blends that combine our signature salt with selected herbs and spices to add that extra zing.&#x201d; &#x2022; Seasoning Salt: the perfect way to boost breakfast, this flavourful combo adds oomph to eggs, drizzle on mealies, fries or hash browns. &#x2022; Chicken Seasoning: use this blend to season chicken or vegetables before roasting or grilling. Rub down some chicken wings or sosaties before braaing or sprinkle into a pan when browning chicken pieces for a casserole or a potjie. &#x2022; Sriracha Salt: We have borrowed some flavours from the popular hot chilli sauce used in Thailand and created seasoning salt that can add a little bite to everything from seafood and burgers to stews and soup. Cerebos Seasoning Salt, Chicken Seasoning Salt and Sriracha Salt are already on the shelves at all major retailers around the country.
