More than their predecessors, this venturesome lot is extremely interested in more personalised hospitality services and products. Immersion travel thus becomes a catchphrase that service providers strive at attaining when offering travel options. While they can best be described as sophisticated, these post-millennials views travel through a more open-minded perspective and are ready to sample as many offerings from the umpteen tourist destinations worldwide. They embrace multiculturalism, are involved with global issues such as environmentalism and are not afraid to explore bohemian odysseys. Whether on a safari in Africa, an ice climbing expedition on Iceland&#x2019;s glaciers, or volcano boarding in Nicaragua, the search for lifetime thrills is endless among the iGeneration. Noticeably all their moments are captured and shared on social media since they are deeply ingrained into the internet of things. They will review online, recommend, and even dissuade their peers not to try certain destinations or accommodation properties if their expectations are unmet.

Furthermore, providing 24hr internet or free Wi-Fi and incorporating tailored sports facilities, as well as social amenities such as a well-stocked onsite bar/club among others, will go a long way in profiting hoteliers who aim at tapping into this highly gainful playfield created by the ruling iGeneration.
