Partnering with 2017 KLINK Awards Best Winelands Burger restaurant finalist, Barley and Biltong Emporium, and leading craft beer producer, Cape Brewing Company (CBC), the Brrrrew Event will kick off with exciting sensory experiences for food, beer and weekend lovers alike. Brrrrew Events will take place on the last Friday of every month (after payday!). The Spice Route Destination took top honours at the fifth annual Lilizela Tourism Awards (Mayoral Tourism Awards) that recently took place in Wellington, in the Western Cape. The Destination clinched the Tourism Business of the Year Award at the prestigious provincial event. All the more reason to experience the Destination's warm hospitality! Aside from prancing out of the office after a long work week, May month&#x2019;s Brrrrew Event guests can look forward to a limited edition flavoured CBC beer on arrival, followed by an exclusive CBC brewery tour with masterbrewer, Wolfgang Koedel. Next, a four-course meal and CBC beer pairing are on the cards alongside live music by Richard Brokensha at Barley and Biltong Emporium. Guests will also get a chance to shake hands with Wolgang Koedel and Barley and Biltong Emporium chef, Philip Pretorius. Additional drinks and kiddies menu will be available at restaurant prices.
