The acquisition presents IS with opportunities for growth through MWEB&#x2019;s established customer base and experience as a consumer-facing ISP. Managing director of IS, Saki Missaikos says: &#x201c;Quality connectivity in a truly digital world is key to delivering excellent customer experience. Our community is the African community, and our objective is to ensure that this community is connected to the world. Both companies have a common vision of providing seamless connectivity for the African consumer at home, on the move, in the office, and in public spaces, and we look forward to welcoming MWEB employees to IS, and the broader Dimension Data family.&#x201d; Market share, specialisation, alignment This transaction is in line with the IS approach of acquiring successful companies that bring with them market share, specialisation but also alignment with the existing culture and people of the company. With all preconditions of the transaction now met, work begins on integrating the two companies, a process that includes providing MWEB with access to new services and talent from across the IS ecosystem. Missaikos says that client experience is a priority, as is minimal disruption and inconvenience to employees, suppliers, and clients.
