This year&#x2019;s theme is Africa moves you. It is the new minister&#x2019;s vision that the continent work together so that we can have a bigger slice of the pie says Amanda Kotze-Nhlapo, chief convention bureau officer at SAT. &#x201c;Not only do we want to show the world what Africa has to offer, but by presenting a fantastic product, we want it to lead to more business and through that have a bigger impact on the economies of the different countries in Africa." Better business This year there is a big focus on enabling exhibitors to do better business. &#x201c;We want to be a real trading platform where contracts are signed, growing the industry and African countries&#x2019; economies,&#x201d; she says. As part of this, and in a bold step, the Indaba has moved away from its traditional dates of over the Mother&#x2019;s Day weekend to mid-week, opening its doors on Tuesday, 16 to 18 May (Thursday). The change in dates is a direct result of consultation with the Indaba&#x2019;s stakeholders. &#x201c;In our debrief with the exhibitors we ask what can we do to help them do better business. It is about helping them get better Return on Investment (ROI). The platform is about the exhibitors,&#x201d; explains Kotze-Nhlapo. It must be working because already weeks ahead of the Indaba, more meetings had been confirmed than hosted in previous years. &#x201c;The Indaba is not just a showcase, but a place where deals are signed. If there are good buyers than there are good exhibitors and vice versa, the two go together,&#x201d; she says. We've streamlined our events programme to give you maximum time to do business.

Last year, the programme was very well received, hosting almost 100 buyers.&#x201d; A new project at the event focuses on high-end tourism. &#x201c;The Luxury Pavilion will, in addition to hosting big names in the luxury tourism, also host boutique guest houses that have a five-star grading.&#x201d; As always, the Indaba networking event was a great success. &#x201c;Previously this event was to add value, but our research shows that buyers found it so useful that we have added it as a business platform.&#x201d;
