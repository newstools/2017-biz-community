PriceCheck Tech & E-Commerce Awards 2016 award winnersAimed at recognising South African organisations and individuals in the e-commerce and technology industries, the annual awards ceremony and tech event will take place at The Westin Cape Town Hotel on 14 September 2017. Kevin Tucker, founder of PriceCheck, notes that the industry gala event is expected to draw in 350 delegates. &#x201c;As the awards are in honour of South African industry movers and shakers, we are not going to be bringing in any international speakers. Rather, the awards will be hosted by innovative South African game changers and will take the form of a TED Talks discussion. Recognising SMEs, NGOs &#x201c;We are also pleased to announce that we have introduced a small business/entrepreneurial competition to the awards. The winner of this category will be selected based on a presentation of his or her business plan, as well as a written submission, and will receive expert guidance and analysis from the panel of judges.&#x201d; &#x201c;We are looking forward to bringing awareness to one area in particular, NGOs that are navigating tech and e-commerce. I hope that the inclusion of &#x2018;The Best use of Tech by an NGO&#x2019; award encourages the public to recognise and nominate an NGO or charitable organisation that is utilising technology to accelerate the exceptional work they do in their community. &#x201c;If anyone knows of, or works with, a tech entrepreneur or innovative e-commerce business that fits the bill for any of these categories, make sure to nominate them within the submission timeframe. Those who nominate their favourite organisation or individual, stand to win a R10,000 cash prize. &#x201c;E-commerce, as a trend is likely to continue expanding into all areas of business, and our local innovators are on track to making South Africa globally competitive in this regard,&#x201d; he concludes.
