VECV, a joint venture between Volvo Group and Eicher Motors, is all set to introduce its leading truck brand, Eicher, into the South African market. Eicher trucks are known for their class-leading fuel efficiency. With a presence in over 32 countries globally, the brand has already started operations in the country through a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary known as VECV South Africa. VECV brings together the Volvo Group&#x2019;s global expertise and technology, along with innovative engineering and proven fuel efficiency from Eicher. This approach has resulted in the development of the Eicher Pro series, designed and developed to usher in a &#x2018;PRO LEAGUE OF TRUCKING&#x2019;. The Eicher Pro series is a range of next generation trucks which are equipped with the latest generation of the Volvo Group&#x2019;s engine management system. Eicher Pro Series has been tested for more than 500,000 kilometres across Africa and Asia, including rigorous endurance and performance testing for over 200,000 kilometres in South Africa. Overriding concerns of fleet owners 2017 will see the introduction of South Africa&#x2019;s Premium Fleet and Light Commercial Vehicle Expo, FleetX, as well as IMHX, South Africa&#x2019;s international Materials Handling Exhibition and Workshop. &#x201c;The fleet industry is a growing sector &#x2013; so it makes perfect sense to align it to TruckX,&#x201d; explains exhibition spokesperson Catherine Larkin. &#x201c;Cost containment, increased efficiencies, and great productivity are the overriding concerns of fleet owners. &#x201c;FleetX is an ideal platform for fleet owners to explore alternatives, learn about the latest developments and engage with new technologies. &#x201c;The addition of FleetX also widens TruckX&#x2019;s appeal to include fleet owners who operate light commercial vehicles&#x201d;, adds Larkin. Move to Kyalami TruckX&#x2019;s relocation to the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit has reportedly opened up possibilities for the show&#x2019;s growth and diversification. &#x201c;With its dynamic handling circuit designed for advanced driver training, its technically challenging 4x4 track, its vast amount of both outdoor and indoor exhibition space, many show participants are using the opportunity to give visitors a hands-on, unforgettable experience,&#x201d; says Larkin. &#x201c;The inclusion of the dynamic handling track and test drives at TruckX is a &#x2018;first for the industry&#x2019; event,&#x201d; continues Larkin. &#x201c;Top vehicles from OEMs including Eicher will be available for test drives around the track&#x201d;.
