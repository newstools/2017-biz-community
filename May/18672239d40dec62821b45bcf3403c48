Alliance Media has partnered with Trees for the Future, a public charity that believes in the power of trees. Trees for the Future (www.trees.org) has planted over 115 million trees in multiple countries and revitalised hundreds of thousands of acres of soil, while changing people&#x2019;s lives forever. &#x201c;Alliance Media has faith in the fact that donating trees will make a much needed difference to an individual community, to numerous countries and on a large scale - to the African continent,&#x201d; says Greg Benatar, Sales and Marketing Director at Alliance Media. Celebrating their 20-year anniversary of business in Africa this year, Alliance Media is known as the leader in pan-African outdoor and airport advertising. Operating in 23 countries, with 20 years experience, Alliance Media has been awarded the European Union Award for innovative media and the prestigious &#x201c;Best Outdoor Advertising Company&#x201d; award in multiple markets for the past nine consecutive years.
