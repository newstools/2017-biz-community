Kantar Millward Brown's Best Liked Ads list celebrates South Africa's favourite TV commercials. These are the ads that have been rated as the best liked by the South African audience who are the most important critic - the person who ultimately chooses to buy your brand or not. Humour tops the list once again, but it is very relevant and subtle humour weaved into a well told story that makes these ads so engaging. Ian Gabriel is well known for his storytelling ability and his absolute dedication to working with actors in a heartfelt way to draw an emotionally engaging performance. "The challenge with The Vodacom Roadtrip commercial was to make sure that a large amount of storytelling could fit successfully into the spot - and still be fun!" says Ian. It is a known fact that people feel first and think second which is why ads such as Vodacom seem to have effortlessly captured the hearts of South African consumers. This is all due to the accessibility and warmth when it comes to storytelling that is unique to our country and the specific nuances of humour and emotional resonance. "The fact that it has been recognised as the Best Liked AD of 2016&#x2019;s last quarter means that it has entertained and resonated well. Everyone loves a funky granny!" shares Ian.
