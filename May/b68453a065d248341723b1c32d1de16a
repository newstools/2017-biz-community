&#x201c;We are confident that Cape Town is more than ready for a Marriott branded hotel,&#x201d; says Alex Kyriakidis, &#x200e;president, Middle East and Africa, Marriott International. &#x201c;South Africans love to travel, and they warm to iconic international brands like Marriott. With South Africa having become a destination of choice for travellers from across the globe, we are bringing the features of the Marriott experience to the country for all to enjoy. &#x201c;South Africa has been ranked among the top 25 tourist destinations in the world, and Cape Town is regularly recognised as a city that should be on everyone&#x2019;s bucket list,&#x201d; Kyriakidis says. &#x201c;Tourism is certainly a growth industry in the country, and the most recent statistics for tourist arrivals to the country reflect the great potential for the country&#x2019;s tourist industry: 10 million international travellers visited during 2016, a 13% increase on the 2015 numbers.&#x201d; Marriott brand facilities Regular Marriott Hotel guests will for the first time in South Africa be able to enjoy the Marriott brand facilities they know so well from around the world: the familiar taste of the Marriott burger; the Greatroom where one can work, play, discuss, and enjoy a top-quality snack or drink; and try out the latest in technology available to guests. Chief among the technology tools are the Marriott App that Marriott Rewards members can use for mobile check-in &#x2013; with keyless check-in to follow in the near future &#x2013; and the Meetings Imagined digital tool for conference organisers. Greatroom daybeds A new look and style The rollout of the conversion means new d cor &#x2013; a look and style that reflects Marriott Hotel&#x2019;s appreciation of its guest identity: achievers with an appreciation of a work-life balance. &#x201c;The hotel interiors tap into the need for places to work that offer easy connectivity, while at the same time providing a variety of spaces for relaxation and enjoyment,&#x201d; says the hotel&#x2019;s general manager, Carolyn Jones. &#x201c;The hotel lobby, the Greatroom, has been redecorated, as have the Orah Bar & Lounge and the Acara Pool Bar & Terrace. The spaces are ideal for networking, working and having fun.&#x201d; Implementing the new brand also means that the well-known Towers Restaurant will soon have a new menu, to be designed by recently-appointed Executive Chef, Henrico Grobbelaar, a leading chef with a dynamic career in the local food industry and a following among food-lovers. The restaurant&#x2019;s fresh approach will tie in with the Marriott standards while still offering the flavours its loyal guests have come to know. Executive Chef Henrico Grobbelaar Combining business and leisure The hotel is perfectly situated for tourists to get a feel for Cape Town as a unique travel destination. The views of Table Mountain from the pool deck and many of the rooms are among the best in the city, and a wine route is close by. In addition, the business traveller will enjoy the top-notch conference facilities and business technology available. Owned by the Rabie Property Group, the 180-room Crystal Towers Hotel has a long history, having started out in 2009 in Cape Town&#x2019;s Century City area as an African Pride hotel. Leon Cohen, managing director of Rabie Property Group, the developer of Century City and the owner of the Cape Town Marriott Hotel Crystal Towers, said they were delighted to welcome such a strong international brand to Cape Town and Century City, in particular. &#x201c;Century City is home to a growing number of prestigious international corporates &#x2013; from Porsche to BMW to Daimler Benz - to Chevron, Thomson Reuters, Absa, Liberty Life, Vodacom, Discovery, Philip Morris and Regus - to name just a few,&#x201d; he comments. &#x201c;The Marriott brand complements all that Century City has to offer and further cements our position as a leading hospitality and commercial hub in the Western Cape. &#x201c;Our recently opened Century City Conference Centre is performing way ahead of our most optimistic expectations, attracting a growing number of national and international conferences. Having a Marriott branded hotel substantially increases our offering and will no doubt appeal in particular to our international delegates.&#x201d;
