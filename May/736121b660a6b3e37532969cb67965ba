Kicking off the first of three Sunday Serenades is an all-woman line-up comprising the people&#x2019;s darling, Gloria Bosman, along with renowned songstress, songwriter and lyricist Omagugu Makhathini, live at Durban&#x2019;s BAT Centre. This stellar performance is earmarked for Sunday, 14 May 2017 &#x2013; coinciding with another special day on South Africa&#x2019;s calendar, Mother&#x2019;s Day. &#x201c;People of Durban, we heard the call and answered. By popular demand, we are proud to bring Gloria Bosman to the city of Durban,&#x201d; says Sindile Xulu, CEO and President of the IJE. &#x201c;She will be accompanied by the effervescent Omagugu Makhathini, who has firm roots in KwaZulu-Natal. &#x201c;We are particularly excited about this edition because it celebrates women in jazz and highlights the need to create equitable and meaningful opportunities for women in the arts in general, and jazz in particular.&#x201d; A celebration of womanity Needing no real introduction, Gloria Bosman is a multiple South African Music Award winner, Kora and Naledi Awards nominee, and a Standard Bank Young Artist (2000). Having taken inspiration from jazz legends such as Sipho &#x201c;Hotstix&#x201d; Mabuse, Hugh Masekela and Oliver Mtukudzi, the talented Bosman has six solo albums to boast. Her contribution to the Sunday Serenades session will be a true celebration of womanity and female jazz prowess in its finest form. Hailing from Nquthu, singer, songwriter, lyricist, vocal coach and choir conductor Omagugu Makhathini brings a new sound to jazz. She started teaching jazz vocals and history of music part time at The BAT Centre whilst studying music in Durban. After completing her studies, she taught contemporary singing and performance at The National School of Arts in Johannesburg. Her contribution to the Sunday Serenades is a voice which perfectly intertwines textures of rhythm, space, melody and harmony. While the Sunday Serenades celebrate our jazz appreciation culture of Sunday jazz, these events also amplify the experience in other, equally significant ways. &#x201c;Each live entertainment session makes a direct economic injection to the local precinct and city by bringing in money and creating jobs for musicians, technicians, chefs, waitresses, bartenders and many other people,&#x201d; explains Xulu.
