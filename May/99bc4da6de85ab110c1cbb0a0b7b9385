Fiat Chrysler said it was aware of two injuries and one fatality potentially related to the problem, according to a chronology submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The defect impacts just over one million Ram pickup trucks manufactured between 2013 and 2016, said documents from the NHTSA. In September 2016, Fiat Chrysler recalled 1.9 million vehicles to address a defect with air bag deployment, which it said was tied to at least three deaths. Source: AFP
