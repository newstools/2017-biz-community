Molefe had left Eskom voluntarily last November after the State of Capture report revealed close to 60 calls exchanged with a member of the Gupta family, raising questions about his proximity to the family and the Tegeta-Optimum coal mine deal signed with the power utility. Molefe had said at the time that his resignation was in &#x201c;the interest of good corporate governance&#x201d;. Lynne Brown, Minister of Public Enterprises, had objected to a pension payout of R30m last month and instructed that the board and Molefe find a "mutually acceptable pension proposal". His return as CEO follows after such an agreement could not be reached. The ANC, meanwhile, has condemned the decision calling it both "unfortunate and reckless".
