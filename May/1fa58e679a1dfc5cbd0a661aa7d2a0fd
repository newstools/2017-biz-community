To celebrate #MayTheFourth aka Star Wars Day, here are some tips to set you on the path to becoming a marketing Jedi. Use the Force The first part of becoming a marketing Jedi &#x2013; learn to recognise your fellow force-users. When it comes to recruiting, the Jedi Council doesn&#x2019;t just sign up any old guy off the street &#x2013; they knew how to find people who could use the Force, wield a lightsabre with flair and obviously look good in pyjamas and a bathrobe. Any agency worth its salt needs to find people with that special something (and who leave their onesies at home). Uninspired talent equals mediocre content. Put together gifted teams and great work will naturally follow. The Dark Side It&#x2019;s no secret that digital marketing has something of a spotted reputation thanks to some agencies&#x2019; unscrupulous tactics. Make sure the Force drives everything you do. Anakin Skywalker didn&#x2019;t set out to be evil &#x2013; he turned to the Dark Side while trying to do what he thought was right for the universe. Avoid unethical practices and poor etiquette like spamming, undermining the competition and plagiarism, even if you think you&#x2019;re doing it for a good cause. You will eventually get a bad reputation and your brand will suffer for it. The Clone Wars If you could be any character in the Star Wars universe, who would you be? Obi Wan Kenobi or a Stormtrooper? Han Solo or a Stormtrooper? Princess Leia or a&#x2026; okay, you get the picture. Being a Stormtrooper sucks &#x2013; it&#x2019;s the Empire equivalent of working in a call centre, complete with crap pay and an extremely high turnover rate. The lesson here &#x2013; don&#x2019;t be a clone of everyone else. Have your own distinct personality or risk being just another dispensable foot soldier. Avoid Jar Jar Binks Most fans don&#x2019;t like the Star Wars prequels because they think it looks and feels nothing like the original trilogy. The Force Awakens, is much more beloved, and it&#x2019;s no coincidence that the script, acting, pacing and direction is much stronger than the prequels. When it comes to your marketing, there are plenty of ways to cut corners and do things the easy way. But if you want to build a truly valuable brand that will last, you must put in the effort to making your product and your content really good. Make sure there&#x2019;s substance at the heart of your communications strategy. A long, long time ago Joseph Campbell came up with the idea of a hero&#x2019;s journey, a powerful narrative that&#x2019;s at the heart of pretty much every myth ever. Luke&#x2019;s story epitomises this and it&#x2019;s one of the reasons that Star Wars is so resonant around the world. Best practices are so named for a reason, so don&#x2019;t feel you have to reinvent the droid for each and every campaign. The Force awakens Finally, if there is one lesson that we can all take away from Star Wars, it&#x2019;s that despite your best efforts, not everything will always go as planned. If there&#x2019;s something that Han, Luke, Rey and Jyn all have in common, it&#x2019;s that they&#x2019;re flexible. 90% of successful marketing is adapting your strategy as needed. If at first your plan to take over the Death Star doesn&#x2019;t succeed, it&#x2019;s time to relook at your tactics. Those are just a couple of Jedi mind tricks to get you started; I have no doubt that thank me you will. *Note: No Wookiees were harmed in the writing of this piece.
