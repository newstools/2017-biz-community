Following the South African Starbucks launch little over a year ago, management says it has evidence of its potential, both in operating metrics and as an investment. Plans are to open eight to 10 Starbucks outlets this year, including expansion to Cape Town and Durban, in formats located in a corporate office and drive-thru.

The idea of chasing that first rand of profit and eschewing the little comforts of a profitable business may not be some people&#x2019;s proverbial &#x2018;cup of tea&#x2019;, but it is in our DNA &#x2013; and a large part of the success of a new venture lies in the persistence required to push through to that first rand of profit,&#x201d; Gonzaga concludes.
