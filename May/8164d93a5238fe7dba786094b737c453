Prof Barry DwolatzkyJCSE director and Tshimologong founder, Prof Barry Dwolatzky, says that applicants need to exhibit a sense of cohesion, drive, and creativity: &#x201c;We are looking for teams of three to five people who either already have a start-up idea, or are in the nascent stages of pursuing it already. This is a fantastic opportunity to boost entrepreneurship and technology, which is vital to the development of our local economy.&#x201d; He says that through the MIT curriculum, classes will cover how to create a business model and how to develop an app. Each team is required to have at least one technical team member that can code or develop app wire frames. To be accepted into the programme each team member must complete one application and once accepted, each team will receive an email confirming their acceptance. Entries close on 24 May and all successful teams will be notified by 9th June 2017. For information on the MIT Global Start-up Labs Programme visit www.facebook.com/mitgslsa/.
