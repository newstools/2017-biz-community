Commenting on the closure of the pool at the Radisson Blu Hotel Waterfront, general manager Debra Sivertsen says: &#x201c;The severity of the situation has led us to take this step. As concerned Cape Town citizens, we would like to minimise our water usage as and when we can.&#x201d; She adds: &#x201c;As a hotel group we are acutely aware of acting in a sustainable manner where possible. We believe local and international guests will understand, as we are facing a drastic situation in Cape Town. We will be monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis and, if the water situation improves, we will revisit opening the pool." Every drop wasted or saved makes a difference Councillor Xanthea Limberg says: &#x201c;Every single drop that is wasted or saved is making a difference to our dam levels.&#x201d; Councillor Limberg is the city&#x2019;s mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy. The latest figures around the consumption of water in Cape Town are 720m litres of collective use per day, which is 120m litres over the city&#x2019;s target of 600m. The proposed Level 4 water restrictions state that &#x201c;No topping of swimming pools at all, either manually or automatically.&#x201d; Cape Town Tourism CEO Enver Duminy, commented: &#x201c;In light of the level 4 water restrictions, it&#x2019;s imperative that all tourism businesses play a role in conserving our valuable resources, not only as a contribution to sustainable and responsible tourism but also as ambassadors of our city. We trust that our visitors will respect that these efforts are made to ensure the long-term continued enjoyment of Cape Town as a world-class destination,&#x201d; said Sivertsen, added that &#x201c;This is a critical time for water in the city and we would ask that all guests at the hotel help us to help Cape Town."
