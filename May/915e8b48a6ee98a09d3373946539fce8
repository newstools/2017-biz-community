She holds a BA Corporate Communications Honours degree from the Rand Afrikaanse University (now UJ) and has experience with PR, event management, social media management, crisis communications and consumer activations. Carla has 13 years of communications experience and joins Grey from Sabio Communications where she worked on a number of FMCG brands with companies such as Kimberly Clark, Tiger Brands, McCain, Famous Brands and Abbott Nutrition, amongst other notable companies. She is passionate about the diversity of South African consumers and engaging with them through unconventional PR tactics. She thrives working in a fast-paced agency environment, where client satisfaction is ensured so, the move to Grey was a natural fit. &#x201d;I am excited about this move in my career and enjoy the challenge of building the department from a new business point of view and, to also mentor and grow the members of the PR team. Showing value and implementing famously effective work for clients is also high on my priority list,&#x201d; said van Pletzen. No stranger to working on integrated marketing strategies, she enjoys being based in an integrated agency where she works closely with the other marketing disciplines on a daily basis.
