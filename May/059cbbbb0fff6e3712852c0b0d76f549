 ximagination 123RF.comTo apply, candidates are requested to adhere to the stringent requirements as set out by Fedhasa Cape, which includes supplying a full academic record, a letter of recommendation from a lecturer, as well as comprehensive motivation highlighting financial obstacles that could hinder study payments. According to Alan Lester, acting vice chairman of Fedhasa Cape, the bursary covers tuition fees, and the training institution is also requested to provide Fedhasa Cape with the student&#x2019;s academic progress at least twice a year. Further to this, if the candidate fails to complete his/her studies, Fedhasa Cape is within its right to request that the candidate repays the bursary in full, and another recipient will be selected from the association&#x2019;s shortlist. &#x201c;There are many worthy students out there who simply cannot afford to see their studies through. We want to change that one by one,&#x201d; Lester says. The application form is available here. Entries must be submitted to Fedhasa Cape before noon on 31 August 2017. Potential candidates will be shortlisted and contacted for an interview.
