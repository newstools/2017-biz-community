&#x201c;Cloud is an operating model, not a place, and adopting a hybrid model has become the clear choice,&#x201d; said Peter Cutts, senior vice president, Hybrid Cloud Platforms, Dell EMC. &#x201c;Making hybrid cloud platforms simple and turnkey enables businesses to rapidly develop and deploy new applications, optimise resources, control costs and deliver the best possible customer experiences.&#x201d; The new offering complements turnkey platforms Dell EMC Enterprise Hybrid Cloud, and Dell EMC Native Hybrid Cloud that integrate hardware, software and automation to simplify IT service delivery and reduce time to market. Consistent experience for on-premises private and public cloud Interoperability between public and private cloud resources has quickly become a top requirement for many organisations&#x2019; IT infrastructures. This platform is engineered with Dell EMC PowerEdge servers and Dell EMC Networking. As a hybrid cloud platform, it is built, sustained and supported as a singular platform with a turnkey stack. The platform offers a true hybrid cloud that speeds application development and deployment by providing a consistent programming surface between Azure and Azure Stack. It is expected to be available direct and from partners worldwide in the second half of the calendar year 2017.
