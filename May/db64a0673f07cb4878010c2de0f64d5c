With the arrival of the fourth industrial revolution, digital Darwinism is restricting more and more brands to connect to their customers. Our consumers are resourceful, they don&#x2019;t trust brands and become anxious about making purchasing decisions. Ad blocking is increasing, and it&#x2019;s becoming difficult to have the brand voices heard within the digital arena. We also have many struggling South Africans who don&#x2019;t fit our &#x201c;target market&#x201d; and they are often abandoned in society.
