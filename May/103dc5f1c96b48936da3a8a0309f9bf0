 mihtiander via 123RF - Buildings on the tiny island near the town of Weligama, Sri Lanka &#x201c;South Africans are looking for something different. Many love Mauritius, Thailand, and Australia and may have travelled there repeatedly, but now they&#x2019;re looking for something different. That&#x2019;s where these destinations come in,&#x201d; says Carlos Luis, land warehouse leader for Flight Centre Travel Group. Sri Lanka at the front of the queue Luis says Sri Lanka is at the front of the hot-destinations-queue because of its beaches, culture, and wildlife. &#x201c;Sri Lanka is becoming a very exciting destination globally and we expect that this will be on South Africans&#x2019; bucket list in 2017,&#x201d; he says. Luis says Sri Lanka and Bali also &#x201c;offer exciting alternatives to clients who love Thailand but are looking for something different&#x201d;. Seychelles and Maldives islands of choice He says the island nations of Seychelles and Maldives are the alternate destinations of choice for South Africans who love visiting Mauritius. &#x201c;For those South Africans who love Mauritius but have travelled there a number of times, we expect Seychelles and the Maldives to feature strongly this year. Although these destinations are often seen as similar kinds of holidays, Seychelles and Maldives offers a different kind of experience with a similar feel,&#x201d; he says. However, Luis says while Sri Lanka and the others are on the up, the old mainstays are still popular. &#x201c;Cape Town, Australia, Thailand, New York and Mauritius might not be the hot destinations this year, but they are still popular destinations for South Africans who will continue to travel there, if not necessarily in the same numbers,&#x201d; he says.
