A panel discussion chaired by newly inaugurated PRISA Vice President, Daniel Munslow on &#x201c;The 5 big changes in the public relations landscape every business should know&#x201d; reinforced the urgent need to develop skills of the new entries into the industry, with the focus being on the Work Integrated Learnership (WIL) within the South African landscape. The outcome of the panel discussion led to an unexpected surprise when three companies opened their doors and offered internship placements to the students that were assisting at the PRISA conference. A few topics such as: Future proofing our profession, Ethics, and Digital transformation in public relations, sparked interest and got delegates debating about the future of the industry. The evening ended on a celebratory note at the PRISA 60th Gala Dinner. The PRISA Golden Medal award for outstanding public relations (that has only been awarded 12 times in the Institute&#x2019;s 60 years of existence) was received by Mohamed Sooliman on behalf of his father Dr Imitiaz Sooliman. Dr Sooliman was honoured for his comparable humanitarian work rendered to South Africans, his country and internationally. &#x201c;Last but not least, we also wish to thank our sponsors for their awesome support as it wouldn&#x2019;t have been possible to pull off such a remarkable conference without them,&#x201d; says Daniel Munslow.
