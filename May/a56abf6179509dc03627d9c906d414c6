Wesgro CEO Tim Harris Hosted at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC), this year's show features over 700 African travel professionals, 300 buyers, and 270 exhibitors. It also features the We Are Africa Innovation Awards which celebrates those who are breaking boundaries in the African travel industry and promoting global consciousness. Wesgro premiered a new advert that showcases some of Cape Town and the Western Cape&#x2019;s most luxurious tourism offers. This is the first in a series that aims to entice tourists from established and emerging high-income regions such as the United Arab Emirates to experience the full range of attractions across the province. Other Cape companies operating in this market who would like to feature in Wesgro&#x2019;s next advert are encouraged to contact us. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re delighted to be partnering with Wesgro as the official partner of our press programme and together we will be bringing 15 highly international travel editors to Cape Town for We Are Africa 2017. We look forward to immersing these influential storytellers in not just the event but also as much of Cape Town and the Western Cape as possible so that they can take incredible stories back to their readers and further increase tourism arrivals in the region,&#x201d; added Serge Dive, CEO, Beyond Luxury Media.
