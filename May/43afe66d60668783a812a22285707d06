Reach for a Dream makes dreams come true for children suffering from serious, often terminal, illnesses. Through this organisation, hundreds of South African kids have been able to enjoy the simple things many of us take for granted, like birthday parties. They are also often given the chance to explore the extraordinary, by going skydiving, for instance, or meeting their life-long heroes. &#x201c;We are proud to be a part of this initiative and it is something that is very close to the company&#x2019;s heart. Having the opportunity to help Reach for a Dream to make children&#x2019;s wishes come true is moving. Slipper Day has become a day for South Africans to come together to show their support for this worthy cause,&#x201d; says Ayanda Peppeta, Wimpy brand manager. This year Slipper Day has shifted style gears, with a colourful wristband designed by Gert-Johan Coetzee, replacing the traditional Slipper Day sticker. Reach for a Dream wristbands can be purchased from all Pick n Pay and Wimpy outlets.
