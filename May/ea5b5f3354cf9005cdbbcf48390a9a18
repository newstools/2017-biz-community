Pre- and post-production companies and the recording studios where the magic happens don&#x2019;t usually get to bask in the limelight of big award wins like the One Show, sometimes not even receiving recognition for the work they put into those campaigns the nation loves. Louis Enslin, owner, composer and producer of Produce Sound. Here, Louis Enslin, owner, composer and producer of Produce Sound, shares his input. Congratulations! Talk us through the way our creative industry collaborates and gets the job done. It&#x2019;s a real honour to be part of projects like these that do well at award ceremonies. We try to get involved as early as possible during the creative process and often bounce a couple of treatment ideas of each other and try some different options, as there&#x2019;s always more than one way to &#x201c;get the job done&#x201d;. Getting into the nitty-gritty, elaborate on your involvement in this specific winning work. For KFC, Vodacom and Flight Centre, at the core of it all is brilliant writing. From there we explored different executions and completed a couple. Working closely with the creatives, we then chose the treatments that we felt were best for the scripts and crafted those: I also composed the music for KFC's Shakin Shakin, and Produce Sound did all the final mix. The work went on to claim a bronze pencil in the 'Film: innovation in film/online' category. Clearly you did this well. Share your opinion on SA&#x2019;s quality of creative work overall, especially as we ended up in 10th country ranking spot at the One Show with a gold and best of discipline in radio. Again, it comes down to the writing. Without that, there&#x2019;s not much &#x2013; but also staying relevant. SA has had two Cannes Lions Radio Grand Prix in the last three years and I think this year will be a &#x201c;good one&#x201d; as well.

What are you most looking forward to from the rest of the year&#x2019;s award circuit, with Cannes Lions around the corner and Loeries just a few months away? We have been lucky to be part of some amazing work that I&#x2019;m sure will continue to do well this year! Looking forward to Cannes the most. As are we!
