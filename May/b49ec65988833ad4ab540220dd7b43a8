South African jury Cannes Lions websiteTerry Savage, chairman of Cannes Lions, said, &#x201c;Our juries are developed in consultation with the industry and the progress we&#x2019;ve achieved so far by working together is transforming the jury gender mix. We know the work doesn&#x2019;t stop at gender and we look forward to working with the industry to tackle other representation issues.&#x201d; Madonna Badger, CCO/founder of Badger and Winters and Cannes Lions&#x2019; See It Be It ambassador, commented, &#x201c;Cannes Lions&#x2019; commitment to diversity and equality shines a light for the entire industry. Whereas only 11% of creative directors are women, Cannes has increased the number of women on juries to 43% this year. The more the juries represent the ratio of men and women in the world, the better the awarded work will be.&#x201d; Jose Papa, MD of Cannes Lions, added, &#x201c;The job of the jury is to identify and award the very best in global creativity, recognising and celebrating work made by all people from all corners of the world. The make-up of this year&#x2019;s juries marks another step forward in the festival&#x2019;s mission to improve diversity among its judges, and is something we&#x2019;re committed to continuing in 2018 and beyond.&#x201d; South African jurorsDesign - Jenny Ehlers, ECD, King James GroupDirect - Roanna Williams, ECD, Joe PublicEntertainment Lions Jury - Jason Xenopoulos, CEO and chief creative officer, Native VMLMedia - Koo Govender, CEO, Dentsu Aegis NetworkMobile - Camilla Clerke, creative director, HellocomputerOutdoor - Peter Khoury, chief creative officer, TBWA\Hunt\LascarisPharma - Mandi Fine, CEO, F/NEPrint & Publishing - jury president - Fran Luckin, chief creative officer, GreyPromo & Activation - Michael Lees-Rolfe, creative director, FoxP2Radio - Mariana O'Kelly, ECD, Ogilvy & Mather Johannesburg
