Controlling automatic updates off Wi-Fi By default, the Google Play store is set to update apps when your phone is connected to the internet. If you do not want your smartphone to perform updates via your personal mobile data plan, you can disable this option and set updates to allow for Wi-Fi only. Go to settings in the Play Store app, click the Automatic Update option and select the desired method. Tip: If you have a limited mobile data package, it is recommended to upgrade via Wi-Fi only. Secure all your purchases on Play Store The Play Store app allows you to add a password that will be required for any purchase. This avoids fraudulent purchases. To enable authentication, go to the application settings and click the "Require Authentication" option. Protect your children If you allow your child to play on your mobile phone or tablet, it is recommended to activate the parental control, in order to restrict access to applications offering sensitive content. Based on the European classification, Play Store will offer you applications according to your age bracket parental control settings: 3+, 7+, 12+, 16+, and 18+. To activate parental control, go to the Play Store settings and select the "Parental Control" option. All you have to do is choose an option that suits you and your family.
