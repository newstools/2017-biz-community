Ricky Wilson takes on the Abu Dhabi desert dunes as part of his 48 Hour Challenge To launch the campaign, Etihad Airways recently challenged Ricky Wilson, singer-songwriter, TV personality and frontman of British indie rock band Kaiser Chiefs, to spend 48 hours exploring the best Abu Dhabi has to offer. The video of his attempt is part of a global online promotional campaign and captures the excitement of the challenge visually to share with consumers on social media and across the airline&#x2019;s communications channels. What a stopover should be &#x201c;For me, a stopover meant sitting in the airport or visiting duty-free, but this is not what a stopover should be,&#x201d; commented the singer. &#x201c;It should be flying falcons across the desert, kayaking, visiting water parks... imbibing the culture of the place. Abu Dhabi has taught me that stopovers can be as relaxing as they are exhilarating. There is something incredibly refreshing about pushing yourself, getting out of your comfort zone and fully immersing yourself in a new city. I will never stay in the airport again during a stopover." Peter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways&#x2019; chief executive officer, said: &#x201c;The launch of Etihad Airways&#x2019; comprehensive stopover programme reinforces what we, who live in this wonderful city, have known for so long &#x2013; that Abu Dhabi is a cosmopolitan, dynamic and thrilling destination packed with opportunities for all visitors, whether they are looking for adventure, culture, or a relaxing beach break."
