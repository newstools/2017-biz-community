Recognising that the world is changing at a rapid pace and intelligent technology is increasingly challenging current thinking, Red & Yellow has created a series of two-day Executive Education Workshops to help today&#x2019;s leaders thrive in the world of tomorrow. For 23 years Red & Yellow has been creating and shaping the leaders of the future and this new initiative has been introduced to equip leaders with the right human skills suited for adapting to an artificially sentient world. The workshops are designed for the progressive leader who understands that in order to get ahead, they need to explore creative business solutions and build teams that help them stay ahead; teams who will go on to be great leaders themselves. Delivered by Red & Yellow&#x2019;s Knowledge Partners - leading industry experts such as EY, Missing Link, Cerebra, Jack Hammer, Human Strategy and more - the focus is on exploring a diverse range of topics critical to business thinking, and success, in the 21st century. Each workshop is presented over two intensive yet rewarding days, focused on giving you actionable knowledge and skills. The workshops promise to deliver a learning experience that is entertaining, inspiring, transformative - and like nothing you&#x2019;ve done before. The workshops are limited to 20 seats each, providing you with an immersive small-classroom environment in which to start conversations, spark new ideas, and network with like-minded peers. The series kicks off on 21 June with The Art of Presenting Data, presented by Don Packett of Missing Link, followed by Strategic Decision Making on 5 July with Wayne Borchardt.
