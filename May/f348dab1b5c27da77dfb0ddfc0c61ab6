The campaign shows how iconic tasteful things are still stylish today and will always be stylish. Although implying their own product, the campaign pays homage to the iconic tuxedo, little black number and the Jaguar E-Type in the print iteration, and the Triumph Bonneville, bowtie and the look of a sartorial gentleman in the TV version. &#x201c;As a brand we have a strong opinion that good taste is timeless. This idea is bigger than the ad campaign; it is who we are at Weylandts. When the truth about a brand is aligned with a human truth, the idea becomes personal and original. With this direction we do not have to sell the brand to customers, we are entertaining them with a thought-provoking message,&#x201d; says Zandberg. Culley adds, &#x201c;TV is there to entertain and inspire and we try to use it thus. The ad has a simple message, told in a visually engaging way, with a great music track. We believe strongly that the growth of the Weylandts brand is down to the level of taste of our directors, buyers and our customers; hence, our message has remained consistent since the in-house agency launched. Each year we look for a new way to communicate this ideal, and this year it was to focus on the customer insight that many purchases are made at Weylandts knowing the product will stay stylish for a long time, staying relevant to you as years go by, and even as you move house.&#x201d; Chris Weylandt and his partner Kim Smith control all furniture and homeware purchases from around the world. In alignment with the latest campaign, they do not buy according to the latest trends or based on price, but purely on what they consider to be tasteful.
