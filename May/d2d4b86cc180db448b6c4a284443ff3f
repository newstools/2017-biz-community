The GSX-R1000A has been highly anticipated by sportsbike enthusiasts across the globe. It features a powerful 200 HP engine (149 kW) and a host of new engine technologies that Suzuki has adapted from its MotoGP programme. It will also be on display at Suzuki&#x2019;s stand inside the main exhibition centre, where it will share the stage with two other brand-new bikes: the 2017 Suzuki SV650 and GSX-250R. Both models arrive at the show shortly after their global unveiling and this will be the very first time that riders, enthusiasts and Suzuki dealers will see the bikes.
