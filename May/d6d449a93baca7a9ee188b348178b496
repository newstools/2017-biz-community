Held in New York, The One Show win was for a BMW radio campaign - the audio final mix and original music were produced at Howard Audio. Adam Howard (owner of Howard Audio) explains: "We were approached by agency OpenCo to produce a three-spot campaign for BMW. After reading the witty, entertaining scripts, I knew this campaign was something special. We just took a good idea and made it even better. This recognition is proof that a great concept gets rewarded when the entire creative team works together to craft a piece of work." Howard Audio also picked up two D&AD Pencils in London, one of the world&#x2019;s top awards shows, for a Cadbury&#x2019;s online campaign. &#x201c;It was based on a simple but brilliant idea,&#x201d; Adam says. &#x201c;The team selected several viral online clips and created a series of 5&#x201d; pre-rolls that appear as if they are actually part of the original videos. We had to make sure our up-front audio exactly matched the subsequent content &#x2013; a tricky task as the audio quality on the Youtube clips was terrible! We spent hours crafting the audio to match the low-grade sound. It really was a challenge.&#x201d; https://www.dandad.org/awards/professional/2017/media/26396/cadbury-pre-joy/ From award-winning original music to cutting edge final mix, give Howard Audio a call to chat about your forthcoming projects.
