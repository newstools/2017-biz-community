Ray will now take full management responsibility for the Etihad Aviation Group, ensure a coordinated group approach, and continue to advance the strategic review that was initiated by the board in 2016 to reposition the business for continued development in what we anticipate being a prolonged period of challenges for global aviation.&#x201d; &#x201c;We have strengthened our group leadership with recent appointments and are now in the advanced stages of recruitment for a new group CEO. The board has been very pleased with the calibre of candidates, and we expect to make an announcement in the next few weeks.&#x201d;
