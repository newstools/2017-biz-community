The company's Racism Stops With Me (RSWM) campaign took top honours in the Best Community Service Campaign and we were placed second in the Best New Print Product and Best Use of Video for the Independent HOME magazine and the "Dont' Look Away" video series for 16 Days of Activism. For the third consecutive year, Independent Media walked away with the Global Media Award for Best in Africa. Executive Chairman, Dr Iqbal Surv , said he was delighted with the achievements. "It is fantastic to see that the RSWM campaign has been recognised globally. Congratulations to the team and our interns. South Africa can show the world how to truly deal with racism," said Dr Surv . The RSWM campaign was initiated by Dr Surv in January 2016, making Independent Media the first media company to actively tackle the scourge of racism in South Africa. Partners who came on board included the South African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (SACTWU), the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and the Fibre Processing and Manufacturing Seta (FP&M) who supported our year-long RSWM internship campaign. Throughout 2016, editorial and marketing teams as well as the RSWM interns mobiised staff members and thousands of readers, business partners, advertisers, civil society organisations, private sector companies, schools, local celebrities, government officials, sporting bodies and personalities and local and international artists to endorse the campaign via a pledge. The response was overwhelmingly positive with the campaign receiving recognition and accolades from various sectors in society. The INMA Global Media Awards take place annually. This year there were 655 entries from news media organisations from around the world.
