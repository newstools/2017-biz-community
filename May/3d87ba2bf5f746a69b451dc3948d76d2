Developed by top engineers, designers and stylists within FCA, the new Giulia embodies the core elements of the Alfa Romeo automotive brand: Distinctive Italian design; innovative powertrains, perfect weight distribution, unique technical solutions and the best power to weight ratio. Autocar says that its 'Game Changers' are cars that 'bring new, higher standards to their classes, or because they defy conventions to benefit buyers.' Of the Giulia, Autocar says: "The Giulia is a riveting, idiosyncratic and striking entrant into a class usually defined by an understated brand of superiority."
