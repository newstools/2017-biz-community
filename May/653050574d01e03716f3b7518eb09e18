Vincent B hrer and Nicol PudelIn these past two months alone, established wineries such as Bouchard Finlayson, Chamonix, Glenelly, Hartenberg, Rust en Vrede, Klein Constantia, Normandie Estate, Uva Mira and Steenberg have joined the portfolio. The site also collaborates with international suppliers to boost its global offering. This month, the Italian family-run Vino.co.za and the distributor Wines of the World also listed their products on the site. Faced with a challenging South African wine landscape, dominated by traditional routes to market, a dwindling wine press and economic indications that wineries are struggling to produce and market wines in a sustainable way, Pudel and B hrer asked themselves: how can technology drive a lively wine conversation and associated sales? Based on the Amazon trading model, its combination of technology, quality and customer service is proving to be a welcome disruption to the South African wine market. The novel online customer experience &#x2013; where wine lovers are guided with visual tasting notes and engaging stories about the wines &#x2013; and a serious collection of local wines offered at cellar door prices, are features that the founders pride themselves in.
