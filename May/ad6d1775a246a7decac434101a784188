&#x201c;Given that our safest place growing up was on Dad&#x2019;s shoulders, we decided to put him back on his pedestal and ask: what would your #SupaHero dad do?&#x201d; In the run-up to Father&#x2019;s Day on 18 June, the campaign comprises three pieces of content showing how a quirky #SupaHero dad shows his kid the ropes when it comes to changing a tyre, checking oil and jump starting a car. Smith says the campaign aims to solidify Supa Quick as the tyre fitment centre with a more human, &#x2018;for everyone&#x2019; approach in order to build brand affiliation and heightened brand awareness.
