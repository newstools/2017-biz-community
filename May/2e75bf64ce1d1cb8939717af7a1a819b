Mall Talkers are offered across a carefully selected mall location base, delivering the best reach and frequency possible. These highly cost-effective static media units are placed at high-traffic areas across the shoppers&#x2019; mall journey and serve to attract, inform and educate shoppers. Mall Talkers are a solution that can be applied to large regional malls as well as smaller community malls across the LSM spectrum. John Faia, GM of Mall Ads&#x2122;, says that, &#x201c;Advertising within the mall environment has become a precise science which takes into consideration a number of key elements such as shopper behaviour, time spent in a mall, time spent in a specific area of a mall, as well as what shoppers actually want. The landlords and the tenants also need to be kept in mind, because malls aren&#x2019;t only about the shoppers, there are other stakeholders all wanting similar success. &#x201c;With this in mind it is imperative that advertising and marketing within this environment is relevant to the consumer, that it adds to the entertainment, escapist and necessity values of a mall environment. A campaign can&#x2019;t simply be intrusive, it has to be relevant,&#x201d; he adds.
