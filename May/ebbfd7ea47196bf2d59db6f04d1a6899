There have been no reports of accidents or injuries relating to the defect. Proactively replacing parts "However, in order to be overly cautious, we are going to be proactively replacing these parts to ensure that no issues arise," the company said. The recall comes as Tesla remains close with General Motors as the US automaker with the highest market capitalisation. Some analysts have expressed scepticism about the meteoric rise in Tesla shares given that the company still sells only a fraction of cars compared with GM or Ford. Tesla shares fell 1.1% to $302.24 in midday trade, giving it a market capitalization of about $50.1 billion, around $1.2 billion below that of GM's. Source: AFP
