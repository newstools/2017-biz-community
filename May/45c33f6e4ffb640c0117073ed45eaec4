Founded in 2016, and based in Cape Town, SustainPower specialises in containerised renewable energy generation. The company focuses on containerised gas to power and solar solutions, with the integration of technologies such as water purification and desalination. African Utility Week was the first official public showcasing of SustainPower&#x2019;s concept and products. The team used the opportunity to display their MAN Engines gas to power generators, combined heat and power plants (CHP) and solar solutions. &#x201c;We have achieved a huge amount in a short space of time. It was wonderful to see it all come together so successfully. African Utility Week allowed us to demonstrate that, despite being new, we are already serious players in the renewable energy sector,&#x201d; says Tobias Hobbach, founder and managing director of SustainPower. Tranportable, safe, durable By placing its generators, combined heat and power plants and solar solutions in 20- and 40-foot sea containers, SustainPower has developed a concept that it believes is easily transportable, safe and durable. The containers can be placed wherever there is a reliable energy source, regardless of terrain. &#x201c;We can produce up to 1100kW in a 40-foot sea container using natural gas, biogas, landfill gas or LPG. We spec our generators per customer requirements and, as a result, we offer a range of neighbouring technologies, maintenance plans, equipment rental and rent-to-own financing options,&#x201d; says Hobbach.
