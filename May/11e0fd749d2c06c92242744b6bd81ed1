Redi has been offered a fellowship in the United States in 2018 which will be an opportunity for her to broaden her broadcast knowledge and expertise. Before she departs on that adventure, she would like to focus her energy and time on working with various local and international stakeholders to devise and launch an effective campaign against sexual violence. &#x201c;We admire and respect her for her choices and wish her the very best with this new chapter,&#x201d; said 702 station manager, Thabisile Mbete. &#x201c;The good news is that Redi will continue to contribute to Primedia for the foreseeable future, even after she stops doing her regular show. We will continue to work with her as opportunities arise, particularly around social justice issues.&#x201d; Redi said that it was with a heavy heart that she will step down from her show: "I am attached and dedicated to Primedia, which has been my home for 12 years. In my travels and endeavours, I will keep this amazing place close to my heart. Primedia and 702 in particular have played a crucial role in the evolution of our democracy and consistently given a voice to the voiceless. The commitment to the country and exercise of independent, hard-hitting but fair journalism make me very proud to have been a part of this great institution.&#x201d; The timing of Redi&#x2019;s departure from afternoon drive has not been finalised yet and she will remain on air for the next few months, which will give the station an opportunity to find a suitable successor who will be announced in due course.
