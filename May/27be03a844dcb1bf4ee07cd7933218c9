&#x201c;We&#x2019;re one month into the project and we&#x2019;re excited to watch some of South Africa&#x2019;s best road trip routes taking shape on our community-sourced online map,&#x201d; says Barend Smit, marketing director of MotorHappy, a subsidiary of Imperial, referring to the Ultimate Journey roadtrip map which is being built through votes and submissions from the South African public. To help create South Africa&#x2019;s best road trip route, visit the Ultimate Journey website and add a destination to the map or vote for destinations already added to the map. Participants stand the chance of winning a R50 000 roadtrip, driven in a new Kia Sportage. If you&#x2019;re looking to explore the area around Cape Town, three of the top roadtrips have already emerged, as voted for by South Africans on the Ultimate Journey website so far. &#x201c;The submissions make it clear that people are looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life,&#x201d; observes Smit. The top three roadtrips from Cape Town are as follows: Hermanus Less than two hours from Cape Town, is Hermanus, one of the greatest treasures of the Whale Coast. Most famous for its whale watching, this town has something for everyone. Enjoy some shopping at the Village Square and the adjacent outdoor market, eat at any of the world-class restaurants or visit little gems like Breakfast Bay, Lovers Cove and Piet se Bos picnic area. Standing on one leg! Boom.

Just over a three-hour drive from Cape Town, this roadtrip is for people looking to immerse themselves in nature with whale viewing, fishing and hiking. Beaverlac Just outside the quaint little town of Porterville is Beaverlac, a wildlife sanctuary where you can camp or stay in cottages. There is a rock pool just a five minute walk from the campsite, or for the more energetic hikers, walk for 90 minutes to reach the Totem Pole pool.

If you&#x2019;re in Durban, Port Elizabeth or any other place in South Africa, visit the Ultimate Journey website to discover the best places to visit in your area.&#x201d;
