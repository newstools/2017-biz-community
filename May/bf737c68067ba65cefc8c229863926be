The opening of the DLTC is a result of a resolved petition by the Gauteng provincial legislature's standing committee on petitions. The Temba DLTC was unofficially opened on 30 January 2017 to provide services to the Hammanskraal and surrounding communities as per the written request/petition to the Legislature to intervene towards reopening of the DLTC. Led by the chairperson, honourable Refilwe Mogale, the standing committee on petitions received a petition in October 2016 from members of the Temba Driving School Association and community members in Hammanskraal, requesting for intervention with regards to the temporary closure of Temba DLTC, as a result of the upgrades and improvements in August 2014. The standing committee intervened and facilitated a resolution process through convening a stakeholders forum that included petitioners, the Gauteng department of roads and transport, as well as TASIMA. Addressing all challenges The engagements that ensued over a period of more than three months resulted in the conclusion of the processes and addressing all challenges towards the reopening of the DLTC, which at some point was frustrated by the legal tussle between the national department of transport and TASIMA during the landmark case involving the eNATIS system used to process the various license registrations and renewals. The standing committee has commended the petitioners for their efforts and patience towards a peaceful resolution of their written grievance and stated that it appreciates the responsiveness and dedication by the department of roads and transport in engaging the petitioners to resolve the petition. The upgraded facility is a legacy of engagement and public participation which the broader community of Hammanskraal and surrounding areas are proud of after a long and challenging process. This was achieved through the petitioning process, and Mogale reminds the people of Gauteng to reach out to the committee on service delivery challenges, without resorting to violent and destructive protests.
