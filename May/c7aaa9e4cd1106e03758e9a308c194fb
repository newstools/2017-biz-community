The 6.4% increase was agreed on by the university and unions last week. NMMU spokeswoman Zandile Mbabela said the original request from unions was 8.61% for salary increases, which was not sustainable. "While plans are in place to drum up third stream income, the university has been forced to focus on the challenging issues of affordability and sustainability," she said. A shortfall in student enrolment targets for this year, coupled with the institution's fees budget being down by 2.5%, was the reason for the 6.4% salary increases, Mbabela said. Source: Herald
