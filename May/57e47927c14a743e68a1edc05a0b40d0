Headline earnings per share (HEPS) were expected to drop by between 30% and 40% from the previous year's R6.22. Lewis said the drop in earning was partly due to its 2016 results benefiting from a one-off windfall of R496m from selling an investment portfolio held in its subsidiary, Monarch Insurance Company. Merchandise sales in its 2017 financial year fell 2.2%, with like-for-like merchandise sales down 9.3%, the trading statement said. Its overall revenue was down 3.3%. "The group's gross profit margin continued to expand in line with management's expectations and improved to 41.6% compared to 38% in the previous year," Lewis said. "Debtor costs for the year increased by 6% reflecting an improvement from the 17% growth reported at the 2016 year-end." Source: BDpro
