The recipes were created to help consumers with recipe ideas for everyday South African staples (like oats and porridge), as well as some exciting and innovative recipes to make for special occasions with friends and family (like Breakfast Cones and Breakfast Pizzas). To increase awareness of the campaign, Bonfire Media challenged 10 top food bloggers to develop Breakfast Party recipes of their own. Bibby&#x2019;s Kitchen, Claire Allen, Food Buzz, Glam Foodie, Kate Liquorice and Pass The Salt were among the bloggers who came to the party creating fun and nutritious breakfast recipes. Consumers stood a chance to win their share of R10,000 worth of weekly cash prizes, by voting for their favourite recipe. To share breakfast inspiration face-to-face Mbongiworks created a suitably fun &#x2018;MINI COOPER&#x2019; mini-breakfast bar taking the NutriDay Breakfast Cone and NutriDay Breakfast Pizza on the road. The mini-breakfast bar will travel Gauteng over the next three months, to celebrate Breakfast with consumers. For more info, go to http://nutridaybreakfast.co.za https://www.facebook.com/mbongiworks/
