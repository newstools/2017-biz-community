Three new 3.0-litre variants now top the Amarok range which, up to now, consisted only of nine 2.0-litre models. Not only is the 3.0-litre Amarok the most powerful double-cab bakkie on the local market it is also more technically advanced than any other bakkie, including veterans such as the Isuzu KB, Navara, Triton Hilux and Ford Ranger. Fastest bakkie on the market To top it all, it is also the fastest bakkie on the market with an 8-second 0-100km.h sprint time, and a top speed of 195km/h! The turbo-diesel Amarok is also one of the most frugal, with a claimed consumption of 9.3-litres/100km. At the media launch, my driving partner and I managed 10.7-litres/100km on a 170km stretch that included stop-start city driving, traffic lights and busy motorways (as well as the odd lead-footed overtaking sprints). The spirited and responsive turbo-diesel engine adds its own additional bragging rights because not only does duty in other VW and Audi models, but also in a few Porsches. This German bakkie&#x2019;s ride quality has always been as good as that of an SUV and the bigger-engined variants feel even classier, moving right into smart sedan-like smoothness. The cabin is spacious, the seats are made for comfort, and the silky-smooth 8-speed transmission goes about its job quietly and efficiently. Snazzy new looks As with all the Amarok models, the new turbo-diesel brags with snazzy new looks that include a new front bumper and grille as well as new alloys. The fancier living quarters get a new dashboard and touchscreen system with USB and aux ports. The V6 also has more sophisticated brakes than the 2.0-litre models with disc brakes all round. All three new models have 4Motion permanent all-wheel drive and electronic differential locks front and rear, as well as a lockable rear differential for real tough challenges. It also has a switch which engages Downhill Assist and off-road ABS. Oodles of confidence I also drove the new V6 on a challenging mountain-side trail in the Free State and was impressed by the ease with which it handles tough conditions, particularly during steep, rock-littered climbs and slippery, sharp declines where it clings with oodles of confidence. The new V6 variants are currently available in Highline and Highline Plus specifications and an Extreme model will join the lineup in the near future with additional features such as Nappa leather seats and 20-inch wheels. Close on 30,000 Amarok variants have been sold since it was launched in South Africa and the bigger-engined versions are going to add another powerful shove to its sales. I have always rated the Amarok top of its class and the new 3.0-litre lifts the bar a good few notches higher. If there is a better bakkie on the market I have yet to drive it. The three new V6 models and prices (including a three-year/100,000km warranty and a five-year/90,000km service plan, are: 3.0 TDI V6 4Motion Highline AT &#x2013; R665,700 3.0 TDI V6 4Motion Highline Plus AT &#x2013; R716,600 3.0 TDI V6 4Motion Extreme &#x2013; R748,600
