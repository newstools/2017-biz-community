 William Perugini via 123RFConsumers are moving towards an anonymous service style like we have seen from the disruptive success globally of technology services like Uber. &#x201c;While hoteliers pride themselves on providing quality human interactions to their guests, the reality is once the check-in and check-out process is finalised, human interaction remains limited,&#x201d; says Ernstzen. He says, more often than not, the entire service experience comes down to just those two interactions. &#x201c;However hard you train your staff, the welcome and goodbye will often remain stereotyped, with predefined style and words. More importantly, the staff has a unique two-minute check-in window at possibly the worst moment of a guest&#x2019;s journey i.e. at the end of a long day. Upselling in that limited window definitely takes skill and tact and the usual, automated emails prior to arrival and the dated in-room clutter/collateral don&#x2019;t greatly increase that upsell rate.&#x201d; Consider implementing a digital strategy &#x201c;If hoteliers wish to increase the touch points with their guests - before, during and after the guest&#x2019;s stay - they need to consider implementing a digital strategy. Just like at home, guests are seeking control, speed and in many cases self-service without the barriers of language or effort to communicate.&#x201d; It all starts with self-service kiosks and online and mobile check-in facilities which eliminate the need for interaction during check-in and out because the kiosk replaces the front desk operator. These fully integrated apps allow tech-savvy travellers to book, use their cellphone as a room key and check-in remotely or utilise a 24-hour hassle-free, self-service kiosk. In-room technology, like iRiS&#x2019;s Guest Valet for example, then focuses on extending that two-minute upsell communication window to the entire guest stay by placing a tablet in every room. &#x201c;This becomes the hub of the hotel room, and the key to the communication and upsell strategy of a property. The combination of easy self-service check-ins, attractive physical in-room devices and recent trends in online food ordering is leading to double-digit growth in food and beverage orders as well as improved ROIs for many hoteliers,&#x201d; concludes Ernstzen.
