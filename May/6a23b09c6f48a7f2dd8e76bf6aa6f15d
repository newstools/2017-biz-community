With a recognisable and unique vocal tone, Lucille Slade who is based is Kimberly, is a singer and formidable songwriter, who offers a new and refreshing take on R&B-pop and urban music. Telling stories that girls and women can relate to, come as a by-product of her experiences. She realised that most women go through similar experiences and that&#x2019;s why they can relate to her music &#x2013; something she doesn&#x2019;t take very lightly. &#x201c;I work well under pressure and no matter what happens the show must go on. My fear doesn&#x2019;t cripple or discourage me; it motivates me. As an artist, not sounding like anyone out there is my strength.&#x201d; Half Zulu and half Xhosa, Lucille&#x2019;s values are rooted in family and God. Her love for the woman who raised her encourages her to keep growing in accordance with her principles. Her biggest highlight so far was winning Transnet Rising Starz, where she met Selaelo Selota who introduced her to Dave Thompson. What does music mean to you? Light. I&#x2019;ve seen so many people light up with music; the mood literally changes and is better after you&#x2019;ve listened to music. That&#x2019;s the greatest feeling ever. Music means light to me. Any funny moments on stage? I always wear chokers, so one of them came undone and I had to pull it off and just throw it up in the air like a G. Your heroes? My mother. Which living person do you admire most and why? Still my mother. I&#x2019;ve seen her struggle. Her constant ability to get up and still choose to be a good person &#x2013; no matter the circumstance. That strength to me is unmatched. It&#x2019;s your round, what are you drinking? Ace and Pearl Gin and Tonic with an orange slice and a sprig of rosemary. The song you wished you wrote? Drake &#x2013; Find your love Drake &#x2013; Unthinkable (performed by Alicia Keys) Dream gig to do? Coachella and Zone 6 venue (my own concert) Any nicknames? Lulu, Noma, Lula. If you were not a musician what would you do? A PR strategist. Pick five words to describe yourself? Forgiving, outspoken, dramatic, passionate, funny. Five desert island discs?

I swear every answer is my mom, but my family is my pillar. What is your favourite word? Literally. Favourite fashion garment? High-waisted pants. Give us some real proper slang and what it means. I&#x2019;m not big on slang but I do know the word &#x201c;lit&#x201d; - when it&#x2019;s the event or situation or person is about to get interesting (both positive and negative). Bomb &#x2013; dope. Top of your bucket list? Bora Bora. Your greatest achievement? Yet to come What do you complain about most often? Being hungry. I&#x2019;m always hungry, even when I&#x2019;m not hungry. What is your fear? Failure. Happiness is? Simple and a choice. On stage I tend to? Use my hands a lot. If you are walking on stage for a keynote speech, what song would you use and why? Sister Bethina &#x2013; it symbolises unity for all South Africans in my mind! The best life lesson you have been taught? Let go and listen to God. Where would you like to be right now? On stage with awesome sound!
