Hugh Norval, owner of Turbine Design, was tasked with the refreshing of the Ad Talent corporate identity. Hugh says: "With Ad Talent having an established identity in the industry, the challenge was to keep some aspects and the feel of the current logo, yet still design something fresh, eye-catching and unique. "In the end, a custom handwritten typeface was decided on, complemented by a similar yellow star linking back to the original logo. Instead of using all the current identity colours in one logo, the existing colours were used as a pallete and applied to backgrounds across the range of business cards, presentation slides and other applications. "We wish Ad Talent many more successful years finding the stars in our industry under the banner of their new logo and identity!&#x201d; Louis du Pisani, owner of Kreatif Kouki, was tasked with refreshing the original website he created. Louis says: "It was an absolute pleasure working with the fresh new logo designed by Hugh and Turbine Design. It's friendly and vibrant and completely revitalises the Ad Talent brand. A breath of fresh air." Brenda says: "I am thrilled with the outcome as I was reluctant to change what had worked for us for so long. Thank you Hugh and Louis and well done to the Ad Talent team for making this journey an exciting adventure for reloading the Ad Talent brand.&#x201d; Go to www.adtalent.co.za and see Ad Talent reloaded.
