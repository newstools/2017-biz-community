rawpixel 123RF.comTo date, brand owners representing annual ad spend of just on R12bn, have given their in-principle intent to subscribe to the new marketing research initiative to replace the defunct Amps, and the minimum level of support needed to make the initiative viable has thus been comfortably exceeded. MA(SA) CEO, Greg Garden expressed praise and thanks to the marketers and companies who have indicated their support for this vital project and for wanting to be a part of the solution to filling the significant gap that exists in consumer based national product and brand research. Saarf chair, Virginia Hollis, announced that a detailed project plan is now in preparation, and all potential subscribers will be given the opportunity to participate in the finalisation of the new research. This will include agreeing on a RFP to market research companies. She confirmed that the upcoming Saarf AGM on 6 June 2017, will mark the change of Saarf to the new Marketing Research Foundation. All participants in the new research will be invited, and the process to bring the Amps replacement product to life will be put in place.&#x201d; Garden also confirmed that the drive to bring even more participants on board, and thus potentially reduce the individual subscriber cost, would continue. &#x201c;Any additional potential subscribers who express their intent ahead of the upcoming AGM will be included in the process, but we must receive your expression of intent before 2 June,&#x201d; he said.
