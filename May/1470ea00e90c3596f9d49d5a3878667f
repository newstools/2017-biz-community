One of these two figures is Taoushiani... 1. Where do you live, work and play? As far away from major traffic and congestion as possible. Johannesburg&#x2019;s northern suburbs have always been my preference. 2. What&#x2019;s your claim to fame? Navigating a successful small business for 23 years through many tough times, with almost no retrenchments. 3. Describe your career so far. I started the business as a graphic design studio in 1994, with a passion for design and creative. My philosophy has always been to evolve with the times as well as with our clients, which in a way made me more of an entrepreneur than an agency boss. Today, I run a fully integrated advertising agency that I&#x2019;m proud to say competes with the best. 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. Simple things that make happiness. Jameson has been my favourite whiskey since the 1990s. I have collected graphic novels since I was in school. I don&#x2019;t believe in bling. I still don&#x2019;t own a watch. 5. What do you love about your industry? Obviously the creative space we operate in. The satisfaction and pride in the work and end product when it&#x2019;s done right and all comes together. 6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Every day is a surprise. My diary is a mutating living being that changes constantly. I still love being involved with the daily grind so I have an inside view and not a top view of the business. 7. What are the tools of your trade? My tools are experience, passion, compassion, self-motivation and, most importantly, vision. 8. Who is getting it right in your industry? There are many companies doing well right now. I think Joe Public have come a long way. Also companies that have finally integrated digital and don&#x2019;t just bolt it on to what they do. 9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. The obvious ones people talk about are transformation and digital integration. 10. What are you working on right now? Technology and innovation in our offering, which enhances the existing delivery. We recently launched a virtual reality campaign and constantly try innovating in social media with things like 360-video and animation. 11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. There are so many and they are so clich . I laugh at ones like &#x201c;How do you eat an elephant &#x2013; one bite at a time!&#x201d; 12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? As my ECD often says, &#x201c;ideas don&#x2019;t have work hours&#x201d;. It could come anywhere and anytime. I often bring home new thinking after a good beach holiday. 13. What&#x2019;s your secret talent/party trick? I give awesome impromptu motivational speeches! 14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? I encourage my team to push the boundaries and we try to adopt what is relevant to us when applicable. Personally, I enjoy the use of technology but, to be honest, don&#x2019;t always understand it. That&#x2019;s where the team comes in. 15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Many contacts, lots of social feeds, news, and of course, family. 16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? First rule &#x2013; If you&#x2019;re not passionate about it, don&#x2019;t do it. This is not a 9-to-5 typical desk job. Mediocrity will not cut it and you have to constantly work hard to improve and succeed. Be willing to put in the hard yards to grow. Too many newbies these days assume that a qualification guarantees success, but it is really up to you, how far and how quickly you progress. Experience is everything. Simple as that.
