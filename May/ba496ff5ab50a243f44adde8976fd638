 Mohamad Razi Bin Husin via 123RFIFJ affiliate the Tunisian National Union of Journalists (SNJT) was central to efforts to establish the council - which it believes will help promote quality journalism - which was officially launched in April.&nbsp; "This is a historic day, not just for journalists (...) but also for Tunisian democracy and freedom of expression in general," said SNJT president N&eacute;ji Bghouri.&nbsp; The Self-Regulatory Council, which has been in the making for several years, will be responsible for drafting a code of ethics.&nbsp;The launch came as concerns have grown over challenges to ethical journalism in a number of media.&nbsp; "We receive numerous complaints from the public about violations committed by the media and the press, in particular for regionalism (...) or racism," Bghouri said.&nbsp; Many Tunisians believe that some media have become tools "to settle accounts, slander, propagate false information and sometimes to spread speeches of violence and hatred," he warned.&nbsp; The new council will seek to educate media in ethics and its new code but will also have a range of tools to address breaches of the code - including warnings and ultimately having the power to remove the professional (press) card from journalists who violate the ethical principles.&nbsp; IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger said: "Journalists' unions have been leading the fight for ethics and press freedom for generations, the SNJT is showing that unions are still at the heart of this battle." *This statement was originally published on&nbsp;ifj.org.&nbsp;
