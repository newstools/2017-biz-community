All boerewors pioneers, connoisseurs and enthusiasts with an exceptional traditional recipe, plus the skills to make boerewors from scratch, are encouraged to enter before 2 June 2017. Over the past 25 years, South Africans from all walks of life, from housewives to butchery managers and even by a (then) 13-year-old primary school learner, have conquered the title of Boerewors Champion. The South African Chefs Association (SACA), a recognised authority on food, will once again take charge of the judging, ensuring that all entries adhere to the guidelines for making traditional boerewors. Entrants will battle it out in six championship rounds held nationwide on Saturday, 1 and 8 July 2017. Three winners from each championship round will then proceed to the Top 18 Round in Cape Town on Saturday, 22 July 2017, where a panel of expert judges from SACA will choose the top three recipes.
