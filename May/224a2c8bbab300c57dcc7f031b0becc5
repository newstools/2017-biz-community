Aftenposten&#x2019;s well-chronicled clash with Facebook over the late Nick Uts&#x2019; picture from the Vietnam War became one of the most important social media events of the year. As one judge remarked, &#x2018;Aftenposten influenced the world beyond Oslo in a powerful way by simply doing good journalism. This campaign was also deploring today&#x2019;s confusion between news and fake news, between news provider and content provider.&#x2019; Six companies won multiple first-place awards: Aftenposten, Fairfax Media, Financial Times, News Corp Australia, News Regional Media, and Schibsted.
