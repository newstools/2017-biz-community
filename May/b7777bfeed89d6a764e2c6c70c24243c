Goddess Var Goddess Var, a bay filly by Var out of Fidelity by Captain Al, was sold by Varsfontein Stud to UK based Shadwell Racing, marking the highest price paid for a Thoroughbred during the sale&#x2019;s 40-year history. The filly is by European champion sprinter Var, who racked up a total of seven wins during his illustrious international career. Her dam, herself a winner, is out of the Champion race mare Promisefrommyheart, also the dam of up-and-coming stallion Master of my Fate. Matador Step, the event&#x2019;s top-selling colt also had pulses racing when, during the first day of the sale, he was knocked down to Form Bloodstock for R4m. The Bay Colt, consigned by Lammerskraal Stud, is by seven-time international winner Silvano and out of Maxixe, a five-time winner and full sister to Capetown Noir and Across the Ice. Matador Step Still a buyers' market Comments Catherine Hartley, TBA Head of Breed Affairs: &#x201c;Despite our top sellers commanding jaw-dropping prices during last week&#x2019;s auction, many very promising thoroughbreds changed hands for, what could be considered, bargain prices. While the sale&#x2019;s aggregate increased by 5%, the sale&#x2019;s average and the median price fell, signaling that, for the most part, it is still a buyers&#x2019; market. For those interested in the pursuit of racehorse ownership, now would be a great time to get involved. As evidenced by the participation of international buyers such as Shadwell, Tony Millard, and James Bester, South African horses still offer great value.&#x201d; During the three-day event, a total of 369 lots were sold, generating an overall aggregate of over R112 million. The average of R303,726 was down from last year&#x2019;s average of R320,015, and the median of R175,000 was also down from last year&#x2019;s R200,000.
