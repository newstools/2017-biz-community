Lylie Moolman, general manager at Giltedge Ocean Islands, chose her favourite five family-friendly resorts in the Seychelles and Maldives. 1. Soneva Jani, Maldives Image: Soneva Jani/Giltedge Ocean Islands Get out of bed and slide directly from your water villa into the ocean. Is this a dream? No, that&#x2019;s a reality at Soneva Jani. Catering for kids and their parents &#x2013; Soneva Jani makes sure that all generations have fun on the island. The new resort is a collection of villas floating on the sea. Kids will love the hammocks, open-air cinemas, and ice-cream parlour. While parents and grandparents will love the cosy, quiet spaces for relaxation. There&#x2019;s also plenty of things for the entire family to enjoy such as an observatory for falling in love with the night sky or eating a scrumptious dinner and looking at screens that show the view through a telescope. Then there&#x2019;s a maze made of hedges, a beautiful spa (where all ages are welcome) and all the fun water and snorkelling activities the Maldives are famous for. 2. One & Only Reethi Rah, Maldives Image: One & Only Reethi Rah/Giltedge Ocean Islands If you and your partner prefer to spend uninterrupted time together, then One & Only Reethi Rah is perfect for you. The resort runs activities for children in three different age groups so that teenagers don&#x2019;t have to hang out with their boring younger siblings. The age groups are 4 &#x2013; 9, 9 &#x2013; 11, and teens. Younger kids can do egg painting during Easter time, learn to make sushi, do arts and crafts &#x2013; and there&#x2019;s even a separate dining room for them. If they do miss you, the One & Only offers fun things to do as a family too. For one, there&#x2019;s a climbing wall. Yes, a climbing wall on an island. The entire family can also enjoy tennis, painting lessons, go out on a speedboat and explore the sea, wakeboarding or waterskiing. If you have teenagers, there&#x2019;s intimate reed-thatched boutiques for window shopping or trying on beach clothes. The aerial island hopping by seaplane is the best family adventure by far. 3. Soneva Fushi, Maldives Image: Soneva Fushi/Giltedge Ocean Islands Going on holidays with kids, parents, cousins and grandparents means that you need space and great food where you can gather and enjoy being together. Maybe there&#x2019;s a glass of wine involved, or a kids&#x2019; platter, some amazing sushi or spaghetti bolognese&#x2026; Either way, at Soneva Fushi there&#x2019;s plenty of spectacular places (and views) for your family to enjoy on the island. Then there&#x2019;s also the chocolate room at Soneva Fushi, which will bring out your inner child. Taste delicious cardamom chocolate truffles, passion fruit pralines, and always changing confectionery. 4. Denis Island, Seychelles Image: Denis Island/Giltedge Ocean Islands This private island experience is great for multigenerational travel with its homely, beach-style cottages and range of activities &#x2013; even though it&#x2019;s such a small island. There&#x2019;s snorkelling equipment, kayaks, and paddles available for everyone to explore the island&#x2019;s waters. Rise early and follow the tracks of the egg-laying sea turtles on the beach or scout the forests for magpie robins and paradise flycatchers to learn more about breeding and tagging projects for these critically endangered birds. Families can also explore the island by bicycle and visit century-old tortoises, the island&#x2019;s poultry coops and animal pens, the chapel and the staff lodging. 5. Fregate Island Private, Seychelles Image: Fregate Island Private/Giltedge Ocean Islands Take your children to this resort... and leave with mini pirates. Fregate Island Private offers kids a Castaway Trail through a jungle (no adults allowed) to hunt for treasures, find ancient tortoises, and get to learn about the island&#x2019;s wildlife. There are also treasure hunts on the beaches and &#x2013; who knows &#x2013; your kids might bring home some gold. Children are in safe hands, and babysitters are available, so mom and dad can go on a romantic private dinner date.
