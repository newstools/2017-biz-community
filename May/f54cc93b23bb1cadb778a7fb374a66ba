These digitals are located in the CBD of Cape Town on Roeland Street, one of the main arteries exiting the city; and on Main Road Claremont, directly adjacent to the largest shopping centre in the southern suburbs Cavendish Square. Both sites target over four million people per month. &#x201c;The aim was to offer consumers a unique OOH location, targeting highly qualified working professionals with the latest digital technology currently available on the market,&#x201d; says Simon Wall, managing director at Tractor Outdoor. Consumers find that digital billboards are eye catching and allow for their content to be easily uploaded or changed; and this is where The Loop network can benefit the consumer in many ways. &#x201c;Our screens offer a high quality (P8) dynamic and flexible digital network which integrates with the latest technology. Our development team has been working extremely hard at getting the first two screens installed and operating. We now look forward to completing the full roll out of The Loop network by the end of the year,&#x201d; says Ben Harris, rights and development director at Tractor Outdoor.
