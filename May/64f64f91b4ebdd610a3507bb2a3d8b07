The uncomfortable truth is that people generally don&#x2019;t care about brands or ads, so their brains filter them out. Ads which engage people creatively and emotionally tend to work better because they&#x2019;re working with the brain, and we&#x2019;re seeing quite a few ads on this list that do just that. People feel first and think second, so ads which take an emotional route have a better chance of breaking through the brain&#x2019;s filters. WE also know that ads that use storytelling are more involving, more noticeable and more memorable. But, they also need to have strong integration of brand throughout the storyline, in order to land these impressions in the name of the brand.
