Gauteng-based applicants aged between 18-25 years were given the opportunity to apply for the anticipated six-month internship through South Africa's official social media pages. To apply, users were requested to post a recent photo of themselves next to their favourite Ferrari explaining why they felt they were the ideal perfect candidate in 200 words or less. Aspirants from across the province applied online using the hashtag #ThePursuitOfExcellence in the hope of qualifying to the next level. Ten of the top applicants were then selected to commence to the interview process. Project to expand to Cape Town, Durban The company will afford a final two individuals the opportunity to undertake a comprehensive six-month internship in both the sales and marketing departments.

The programme offers a valuable opportunity to gain knowledge and understanding of the holistic business model and contribute to assisting the relevant departments on various different tasks," says Jan Ungerer, COO of Scuderia South Africa. Interns also provide raw talent that can be shaped into targeted and focused employees who can make a long-term contribution to the development of the company. These interns can jump-start their careers through such programmes and have the opportunity to gain greater responsibility, whilst also building a firm base of contacts and experience and gain specialised training.
