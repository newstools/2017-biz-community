The change takes effect immediately. Dloti had been Liberty CEO for a little over three years. Taking the reins is David Munro, CEO of corporate and investment banking at Standard Bank. "Thabo believes that given this environment, alignment amongst key stakeholders is imperative to ensure the effective execution of the strategy required to drive the company forward. This alignment coupled with the ability to act decisively is in the best interests of the company and hence Thabo is stepping aside," Liberty said. Standard Bank said in a separate Sens announcement that Kenny Fihla, the current deputy CEO and head of client coverage at the corporate and investment banking unit, would succeed Munro.
