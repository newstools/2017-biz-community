 adiruch 123RF.comStronger forms of ethical leadership, ethical decision-making, ethical behaviour, ethical organisational cultures and ethical values are vital drivers of organisational success and societal prosperity but unethical practices and transgressions by private and public sector organisations appear to be on the increase. What is ethical leadership, and how can it be harnessed to create and cultivate a stronger strain of forward-thinking, responsible and sustainable organisations? The summit will unpack these and other critical points with its line-up of guest speakers, who will discuss themes of ethical leadership, find solutions to barriers that prohibit ethical leadership and explore new ideas and best practices around this topic. Speakers Sipho Mila Pityana, chairman of AngloGold Ashanti and Onelogix will discuss ethical leadership in times of questionable business and government conduct Brand Pretorius, former chairman and CEO of McCarthy Motor Holdings as well as McCarthy Retail Limited, will examine ethical behaviour, as a pre-requisite for effective leadership Skhumbuzo Macozoma, SANRAL&#x2019;s newly appointed CEO, will explore the purpose of leadership and leading with purpose Lincoln Mali, Standard Bank&#x2019;s group head of card and emerging payments across Africa in personal and business banking and author of the blog www.leadershipconversations.co.za Nosipho Damasane, chairwoman of the Richards Bay Coal Terminal and a non-executive director of JSE-listed WBHO, will discuss the impact of ethical leadership on organisational performance and employee behaviour Dr Jeff Govender, owner and md of the Famhealth Medipark, The Herald Citizen of the Year (2011) winner in Sustainable Development and board member of the Northern Areas Development Trust, will provide a case study on &#x2018;Famhealth Medipark story: Empowering Communities&#x2019;</li></li></li></li></li>&#x201c;When ethical leadership, which is deeply essential for a transforming and sustainable society, is non-existent, the fabric of society and its institutions become soiled. Organisations must demonstrate its important role in society by functioning with a much clearer purpose and with higher levels of integrity, respect and responsibility,&#x201d; said Dr Randall Jonas, director of NMMU Business School, one of the conveners of the Nelson Mandela Bay Leadership Summit. &#x201c;This allows organisations to cut a more sustainable path in the future and to add real value to employees, stakeholders, shareholders, communities and the natural environment. &#x201c;Through this year&#x2019;s summit, we want to empower leaders to become lighthouses of hope and inspiration in an uncertain and broken world, a world sometimes full of unknown unknowns,&#x201d; concluded Jonas. The event is an initiative of the Ukuvula Foundation and NMMU Business School and is supported by sponsors Standard Bank, VWSA, Kwantu Private Game Reserve, Metrosecurity, Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA), Rennies and the Boardwalk.
