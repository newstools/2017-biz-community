The event will be hosted by United Drone Holdings (UDH) &#x2013; an entrepreneurial focused drone-service business, committed to educating and informing drone pilots on the industry. UDH offers solutions to commercial and industrial industries looking to optimise workflow, security, and fundamental business functions by using drone technology. One of the business&#x2019;s core focus areas is training drone pilots and producing committed graduates. According to UDH CEO, Sean Reitz, in addition to mining and agricultural applications, other key industries, like safety and security, which includes the South African Police Service (SAPS), forensics, and property are now making use of drone technology. &#x201c;Drones do things humans can&#x2019;t, they go where humans can&#x2019;t go and they&#x2019;ve been largely beneficial for these industries,&#x201d; Reitz says. Speakers, topics The upcoming conference, which takes place at Vodacom World&#x2019;s Conference Centre, includes a lineup of 35 speakers and aims to outline the number of challenges that relate to the regulation of drones in the country, as well as brainstorm solutions to these problems. &#x201c;The regulatory environment in South Africa is the greatest limiting factor to the development of this industry and is governed primarily by the SACAA. Being a commercial drone operator is an immensely responsible job and regulations play an overarching role in shaping and controlling the business,&#x201d; he says. Other topics of discussion include debates on emerging technologies in the drone space and the effective use of drone technology during search and rescue operations conducted by the SAPS.
