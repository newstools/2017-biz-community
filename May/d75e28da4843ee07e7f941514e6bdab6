Ryan Hunt Request for sponsors Both Global ASP and Hunt&#x2019;s Tork Craft brand, plus their overseas suppliers will again be assisting the team, however, there are many costs to be covered and the team is requesting for sponsors to come on board. &#x201c;We pretty much have the complete deal together, but to make it all happen we need help on our main costs which is the airfares, accommodation in the UK, shipping the bikes, and general expenses. So, any sponsors that would like to help get this legendry Springbok veteran motocross team to the UK would be welcomed and a great help to the team,&#x201d; said Williams. &#x201c;In return for covering these costs the partner/sponsor will be made a full co-sponsor of the team and will be given the branding on the riders, and their motorcycles, the team will also enter under this sponsors name, plus sponsors will benefit from the pre-and-post PR coverage, branding at the track in the team&#x2019;s pits and the TV coverage which we bring back to be flighted on our local channels. The complete program will include a full pre-and-post marketing service, inclusive of print, online, Facebook, radio and TV, which is a pretty good package for any sponsor,&#x201d; said Williams.
