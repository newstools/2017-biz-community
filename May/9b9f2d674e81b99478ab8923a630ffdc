In the meantime the MPC is understandably remaining cautious until more evidence has emerged about the balance of risks in economic outlook, and what unpredictable strains might yet still be imposed in the economy. By the time the MPC meets again at the end of July there should be more clarity about Moody's anticipated decision on SA's domestic currency downgrade, the ANC policy conference will have taken place, and there may be a less volatile element in global sentiment about emerging markets. The MPC will then be in a better position to make a judgement call on future interest rates and confirm that SA is indeed at the end of the interest rate tightening cycle. The fact that the MPC has now reduced its growth forecast for 2017, having inexplicably and in retrospect unwisely raised it at its previous meeting, merely confirms the view of many economists that recent political developments have increased the downside risks to economic growth. The MPC reference to the continued weakness in private fixed capital investment again emphasises why strengthening investor confidence remains essential to SA's future economic performance.
