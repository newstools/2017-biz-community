Led by the US Mission to South Africa and in partnership with the World Bank&#x2019;s Connect4Climate and GreenCape, the interactive workshop took place in Cape Town, equipping participants with communications skills &#x2013; ranging from community theatre to cartoon storytelling, podcasts, infographics and mobile video production - to tell their renewable energy stories. &#x201c;South Africa&#x2019;s renewable energy sector has become recognised as one of the country&#x2019;s success stories over the years. It is for this reason that we are using our collective experience to support the country&#x2019;s renewable energy future,&#x201d; says US Consul General in Cape Town Teddy Taylor. Challenges remain However, many of the workshop participants agreed that there are still challenges that need to be addressed. These include common misperceptions about costs and low levels of awareness around local green energy technology. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re hoping that today&#x2019;s participation will continue to raise the profile of renewables and create a network to share communications goals and aspirations for SA&#x2019;s energy future.&#x201d; He added: &#x201c;We, as the US Mission to South Africa, are excited about this long-lasting relationship to achieve energy solutions in this country well into the future.&#x201d; The Cape Town event is a follow-up to the first Energy21: Exchange Hub workshop that took place in Pretoria in late 2016.
