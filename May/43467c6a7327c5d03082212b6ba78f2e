We love the way Dan works and don&#x2019;t want to mould him into a traditional commercial director, but rather give him great production support and mentor him into developing the relationships with agencies, clients and collaborators that are so critical.&#x201d; Dan&#x2019;s first commercial, Tusker Here&#x2019;s to Us with Net#work BBDO, is one of the most acclaimed spots of the year, having already picked up an African Cristal Film Grand Prix; two One Show craft merits; Creative Circle Ad of the Month; Ad of the Week from MarkLives; and a Special Mention on ididtht&#x2019;s SA Film Reel, among other accolades. On their website, Net#work BBDO raved about the experience of working with him. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s only 26 years old and has never shot a commercial before this. His films&#x2026; have until now been made as content videos for YouTube, which gives this work a super fresh look and feel. Very un-ad-like, which we like very much.&#x201d; Dan&#x2019;s rapidly building a commercials reel, most recently directing a Capitec ad with Switch, but he&#x2019;s hardly a newcomer to filmmaking, having been behind the camera professionally since 16. Over the last ten years, Dan has directed over 100 music videos, documentaries and short films, shooting on four continents for the likes of Red Bull, CNN, Roxy and Matt Simons. GrindTV also hailed him as &#x201c;more than the best up-and-coming surf filmmaker in the business... becoming a voice for his generation.&#x201d; His work has nearly 20m views on YouTube, where his independent channel, DantheDirector, has over 70,000 subscribers. He&#x2019;s currently collaborating with YouTube sensation Casey Neistat, who&#x2019;s been a friend and mentor to him. Dan&#x2019;s no slouch on Instagram either, where he has over 60,000 followers. &#x201c;I am extremely new to this whole ad world and production house industry,&#x201d; says Dan. &#x201c;It seemed scary at first, as if my ideas would get altered into &#x2018;TV ads.&#x2019; I tried out a few options with production houses, but when meeting Colin it was a no brainer for me to want to join the team. The opportunities here are endless. I can still focus on my YouTube projects and at the same time grow as a creative and film director - being guided by people I have been looking up to for years. I am super excited for the future and to jump onto some experimental and forward-thinking boards!&#x201d; See more of Dan&#x2019;s work at https://eggfilms.tv/south-african-commercials-director/dan-mace/.
