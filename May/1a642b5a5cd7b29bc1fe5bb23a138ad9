Gavin EmesCommenting on his new role Emes said, &#x201c;The fit is a natural one for me, as I was part of the team that launched location-based &#x2018;Weve&#x2019; in the UK many years ago and have always viewed location as the future of mobile. In my experience the African market is hungry for innovation, and also loyal to local publishing platforms. Vicinity Media&#x2019;s technology and premium African network will tick both boxes.&#x201d; Gavin is not the only new appointment at Vicinity. The Ad Ops department has been bolstered by Bryce Betha and Lerato Modibedi, taking the team to five strong. The Cape Town-based Development team has also recently welcomed David Jansen van Vurren and Ed Dikotape as Vicinity completes it&#x2019;s move from an outsourced to a completely internal tech team. Vicinity Media currently operates in South Africa, across Africa and the Middle East and in the UK. For more information
