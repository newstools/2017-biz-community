Presented by long-time SAFREA member Tiffany Markman, the topic is titled: "Taking the &#x2018;free&#x2019; out of freelancing: five ways to be a more successful creative". &#x201c;Successful freelancing is about business as much as it is about creative talent,&#x201d; says Markman. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m excited to share some tried-and-tested tips with colleagues, acquaintances and guests at Madex, en route to making us all better money-makers.&#x201d; Markman is an internationally sought-after freelance copywriter, editor and writing skills trainer. As a successful marketing entrepreneur, she has made a name for herself in the freelancing market both as an expert and advisor. SAFREA is thrilled to have her represent the association at Madex. &#x201c;Madex is an important event that brings together leaders in the communications industry. Our hope is to inspire freelancers there to think out of the box when growing their careers,&#x201d; says SAFREA Chair Laura Rawden.

It features over 20 different sessions on topics including digital strategies, mobile marketing, communications trends and more. Madex runs from Wednesday, 7 June, to Thursday, 8 June, at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg. Guests can attend Markman&#x2019;s session on 8 June at 1:30pm.
