Select celebrities like Natani l, Jenny Morris, Amore Bekker and Carmen Niehaus entertained and inspired cheese lovers to new culinary heights. Image Supplied One of the additions to this year&#x2019;s programme was the Agri-Expo Cheesery where visitors were able to spend quality time with some of the country&#x2019;s best cheese makers. According to Mags Baleta from Klein River Cheese outside Stanford this provided cheeseries with the ideal opportunity to share their expertise with consumers and to perform important market research. Cheese makers put their best foot forward by wooing the consumer with new and innovative cheeses, including those flavoured with coffee, red wine, and lavender. Artisan cheese makers taking part for the first time agreed that the broad and simultaneous exposure of their products to such a large group of cheese lovers is indeed invaluable.
