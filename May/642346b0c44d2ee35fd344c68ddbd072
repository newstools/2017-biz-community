The program helps MSPs to address the growing demand for IT security services and enables them to attract new customers in the SMB markets, while satisfying existing customers looking to outsource all IT functions, including security, to a trusted third-party. Riaan Badenhorst, managing director, Kaspersky Lab Africa says: &ldquo;Kaspersky Lab&rsquo;s MSP Program was created specifically to meet the needs of partners who want to grow their managed service offerings in cybersecurity &ndash; without additional administrative overheads or resources. The program is based on the world&rsquo;s most tested, most awarded multi-layered security solutions. It allows MSP partners to secure the complete customer infrastructure, from mobile devices and desktops to physical and virtual servers, with our comprehensive portfolio that can be delivered both on-premises or from the cloud.&rdquo;
