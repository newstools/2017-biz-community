It is South Africa&#x2019;s longest running and largest pop culture event &#x2013; the destination for leading gaming and pop culture experts and anyone looking to celebrate their fantasy world while being immersed in a compelling and exciting storyline. This celebration of gaming, storytelling, role-playing and tech positions Icon CGC as the ideal introduction to gaming for people of all ages and interests. SA&#x2019;s most important gathering of geeks, it is seen by industry insiders as being on a par with the best hobby gaming conventions in the world. This year Icon raises its &#x2018;game&#x2019; substantially, showcasing international guests, local thought leaders, over 40 speaker panels, expert player showdowns, a comedy event and innovative activations including multinational tech giants such as Canon Gigabyte and MakerBot, amongst others. Media partners, student brands and Nickelodeon will ensure that the best moments of this 25th edition live on beyond the boundaries of the convention. Les Allen, ICON&#x2019;s director says, &#x201c;What we&#x2019;ve learnt from a quarter century convening Icon is that &#x2018;geeks&#x2019; are no longer on the fringe. Mainstream media exposure has made their expertise, enthusiasm and points of obsession with hobbies and intellectual pursuits accessible. Gaming and storytelling releases a part of everyone&#x2019;s being, we just facilitate access to it in a myriad of ways.&#x201d; Vampy Bit Me and Valerian panels International Cosplay guest of honour for #ICON2017 is the sensational Linda Le, aka. &#x201c;Vampy Bit Me&#x201d;, rated as one of the ten most popular cosplayers in the world and an inspiration to all those who invest in building characters for fantasy world. Gaming industry insider James Stutter, a published author and the co-creator of the fantasy Pathfinder&#x2019; Roleplaying Game and Creative Director of the new space version Starfinder also joins the convention. Both will participate in the convention for all three days.
