It is for this reason that we are using our collective experience to support this sector as it prepares to transition to its next phase of growth in South Africa&#x2019;s energy future.&#x201d; The hands-on Cape event is the second Exchange Hub, following an earlier workshop held in late 2016 where local experts and participants echoed the need to champion South Africa&#x2019;s renewable energy story. Communication know-how &#x201c;Now that we have collaboratively identified the challenges faced when amplifying South Africa&#x2019;s renewable energy story, we intend to use the Cape Town workshop to equip participants with the communication know-how. Participants will be paired with communications experts to transform their powerful stories into effective content to engage audiences,&#x201d; explains David Shelby, director of Public Engagement at the US State Department. &#x201c;This is not a once-off event - the conversations generated at the Energy21: Exchange Hub will continue after May with the intention of creating a strong and connected network within South Africa&#x2019;s renewable energy sector,&#x201d; says Shelby. He adds: &#x201c;An action plan developed by Energy21: Exchange Hub participants will continue to inform our collective communications efforts throughout 2017.&#x201d;
