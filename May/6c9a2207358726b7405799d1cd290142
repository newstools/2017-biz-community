This year, the project is on track to train 120 previously unemployed women. The TFG trainees will again be producing 40,000 blankets and will also be creating a range of children&#x2019;s hoodies at its Prestige factories in Maitland and Caledon. The SewGood programme has accomplished what few corporate programmes can: to train new and previously unemployed recruits, with the product of that training benefiting tens of thousands of underprivileged or disaster-hit people, all while instilling a sense of pride in those whose daily work makes a real difference in the lives of the less fortunate. A symbol of job creation &#x201c;Each of our purple blankets &#x2013; which have become ubiquitous in the Caledon community and in communities trying to recover from severe challenges &#x2013; is not just a blanket, but a symbol of job creation that enables us to keep the nation warm,&#x201d; says Mymoena Mooradd, CSI manager at TFG. &#x201c;The concept of &#x2018;shared value&#x2019; is often cited in CSI programmes but can easily amount to little more than a corporate buzzword. Our flagship project is, however, leading the way in demonstrating how shared value can be achieved for the benefit of all involved, whether it is the company, the community, individuals and workers, or broader society. &#x201c;We have partnered with Gift of the Givers, which is best placed in the work that it does to distribute the blankets where they are needed most.&#x201d; Some of the recipients over the past two years since the programme&#x2019;s inception include fire victims from the communities of Imizamo Yethu, Hangberg, Du Noon, Philippi, Nyanga, Masiphumelele, and flood victims from Alexandra, among others. An additional 22,000 blankets were donated in various winter drives, for communities who had to face winter&#x2019;s bite with very little. Investing in local production &#x201c;The vision for the SewGood project is to continue to strengthen and grow TFG&#x2019;s Shared Value strategy by investing in local production. We are very proud of this project, which provides a leading example of how a company can positively impact communities on a local and national level by using resources integral to the company&#x2019;s business,&#x201d; concludes Mooradd. In partnership with the Gift of the Givers, TFG says it hopes that SewGood&#x2019;s model of impact investment will inspire other companies and organisations to investigate how they can implement shared value programmes which can at once positively impact their business, the communities in which their businesses operate, South African society in general and also individuals in need.
