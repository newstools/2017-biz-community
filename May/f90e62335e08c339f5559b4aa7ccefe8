 Cannes Lions websiteBraindates Braindates is a new networking and peer-learning platform to support the Cannes Lions global community in meeting and learning from each other. Taking place at the new Connections Beach, Braindates, powered by e180, allows attendees to connect with the right people and book one-on-one networking sessions, based on shared passion and knowledge, regardless of career level. All official Cannes Lions delegates can log in to the Braindates website to book and &#x2018;offer&#x2019; their experience, or &#x2018;request&#x2019; knowledge on subjects of interest. The Cannes Lions Connections Beach will have onsite &#x2018;matchmakers&#x2019; to help facilitate 1-on-1 connections between 10am to 3pm daily throughout the festival. Connect Band New this year, the Connect Band is a piece of wearable technology to make networking easier. Attendees can pick up their Connect Band throughout the festival to facilitate digital data exchange. Once delegates register their wristband, they simply &#x2018;bump bands&#x2019; with other wearers to swap contact information and download it through a smartphone app. Jose Papa, MD of Cannes Lions, said, &#x201c;Cannes Lions is all about driving ideas and fostering new partnerships and we&#x2019;re delighted to be able to blend digital and real world connections with both Braindates and the Connect Band this year. It&#x2019;s an opportunity for our global community to learn from each, be challenged and inspired &#x2013; we can&#x2019;t wait to get started.&#x201d; Anatoly Roytman, head of Eala, Accenture Interactive, added, &#x201c;Cannes Lions welcomes thousands of the industry&#x2019;s best and brightest and, while many cite networking as a major reason for coming, the process can be overwhelming. Through the Connect Band and Braindates, we are helping to remove barriers and connect people for meaningful conversations in a fun, easy to use way. We are excited to be the Cannes Lions connections partner, helping to bring the industry together. Other festival networking highlights include twice as many Cannes Lions &#x2018;meet ups&#x2019; than in 2016. This year&#x2019;s 24 meet ups are hosted by handpicked industry experts, who facilitate conversations, generate ideas and help make lasting connections. The series of curated networking sessions, themed around a particular area of interest, are a chance to connect with a global community focused on a common goal.
