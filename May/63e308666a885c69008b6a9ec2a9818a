TOCC serves as the umbrella organisation for The One Show, ADC Annual Awards, Young Guns, Creative Week, One Screen, Hall of Fame and nearly a dozen successful global programs that fall under four key pillars: education, inclusion and diversity, professional development and gender equality. &#x201c;No other global creative organization gives back to the advertising and design industries with this level of comprehensive educational and development programming,&#x201d; said Kevin Swanepoel, CEO of The One Club. &#x201c;ADC Annual Awards and The One Show celebrate creative excellence on a global level, as well as generate revenue that is funneled right back into the industry to fund this important programming." The ADC 96th Annual Awards and other organization activities throughout the year are made possible in part through the generous support of global partner Shutterstock. &#x201c;Shutterstock is proud to be a longtime sponsor of ADC and its community, and we&#x2019;re excited to continue our close relationship as the organization grows together with The One Club for Creativity,&#x201d; said Terrence Morash, creative director at Shutterstock. &#x201c;Our shared goal of nurturing and propelling the global creative community forward makes this partnership a natural fit, and we look forward to working with ADC to produce programming with a focus on craft, design and innovation."
