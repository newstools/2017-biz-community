DENYS Rudyi 123RF.com The AFP charter defines, in six key points, the principles of reliability, impartiality and fairness applied by AFP in its coverage of world news, as guaranteed by its statute. It also reiterates journalists&#x2019; right to exercise their profession independently, without being subject to influence, attacks or threats. The 30-page document on ethics and best editorial practices restates these principles in detail. The text, which reprises some of the ethics guidelines contained in the Agency&#x2019;s stylebook, also gives recommendations regarding coverage of major events such as conflicts, elections, stock market news and scientific discoveries. In keeping with the changing media environment, the document addresses the growing role of social media as news sources and the rise of user-generated content &#x2013; both of which must be rigorously authenticated and verified.
