Osinbajo praised hosts Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) for bringing together the public and private sector to develop Africa's much-needed infrastructure projects and joined the ministers of finance, trade and economy from Nigeria, The Gambia and Uganda respectively, to debate some of the industry's key challenges and opportunities, including how to make infrastructure projects bankable. Early stages are crucial Andrew Alli, president and chief executive of AFC who opened the summit on Monday, 15 May, commented on the importance of project development expertise in African infrastructure investment: "The earliest stage of conception and development of any project is crucial. Private capital will not come to invest in African infrastructure if projects are not sustainable and bankable. "By focusing on supporting project development and using our local knowledge and sector expertise to identify and mitigate risks, we can help accelerate the number of viable, bankable projects across the continent, creating the market for other forms of capital to follow, and ultimately bridge the investment divide that currently exists."
