They&#x2019;ll perform there on Friday, 10 November 2017 and in Cape Town&#x2019;s Grand Arena at GrandWest on Tuesday, 7 November 2017. &#x201c;Fans of +LIVE+ have always shown incredible support when this band tours SA&#x201d; says Amp CEO, Andy Mac. &#x201c;We saw all tickets sell-out in record time when their lead singer Ed Kowalczyk toured Joburg and Cape Town in 2015 for the Throwing Copper Anniversary Tour. We expect the same to happen for this reunion tour. Bands with a great legacy, such as +LIVE+, are the reason I started Amp Events and I can&#x2019;t wait to see these guys rock out on stage&#x201d;. This year is 25th anniversary of +LIVE+&#x2019;s debut album The original line-up of +LIVE+ --Ed Kowalczyk (vocals, guitar), Chad Taylor (guitar, backing vocals), Patrick Dahlheimer (bass) and Chad Gracey (drums, percussion) recently reunited for this worldwide tour. 2017 will mark the 25th anniversary of their debut album Mental Jewelry (released on 31 December 1991). The multi-platinum band from Pennsylvania have sold over 22m albums worldwide and earned two number one albums (Throwing Copper, Secret Samadhi). Their catalogue is filled with such gems as Lightning Crashes, I Alone, All Over You, and Lakini&#x2019;s Juice, which live on today as classics at rock radio. The original line-up of +LIVE+ performed their last show in July 2009 before going off in different directions. Rediscovering their friendship has healed old differences, setting the stage for the four members to come together to make music again. For complete tour and ticketing details, click here.
