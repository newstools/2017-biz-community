The mobile facility also offers the digital shredding of hard drives, solid state drives and data tapes, and also the degaussing of HDD and tapes. Xperien senior business development manager, Bridgette Vermaak, says data destruction requirements are constantly evolving and service providers need to adapt by investing in versatile equipment. &#x201c;We have recognised the demand for versatile data destruction and have introduced a new business model, to use shredding trucks for mobile hard drive destruction.&#x201d; &#x201c;The main advantage this truck brings to data security is that it eliminates the need to provide a chain of custody for the client&#x2019;s data because the truck comes to the client&#x2019;s premises. Hard drives made of aluminium, steel and other metal alloys require huge amount to shred into tiny pieces and would normally happen in an industrial factory,&#x201d; she explains. Portability, efficiency Vermaak says mobile shredding trucks are the answer to portability and efficiency in data destruction.
