Expert Guidance Both associations benchmarks for travel buyers Both associations represent professionalism in our industry and are benchmarks for travel buyers when considering the appointment of a TMC, says Otto de Vries, CEO ASATA. ABTA founder, Monique Swart, highlights the reputation that ABTA and ASATA have within the corporate travel sector. &#x201c;Travel buyers trust these two bodies do a great deal to elevate the level of the industry across South Africa.&#x201d; The successful collaboration between ASATA and ABTA is adding meaningful value to the industry, which &#x201c;further highlights the message of engaging with industry professionals that are members of our associations.&#x201d; Respondents to the survey say these are the greatest benefits of ASATA: &#x2022; 81% believe the association ensures credibility of the industry &#x2022; 63% indicate that ASATA ensures the professionalism of the industry. &#x201c;I think there is still a lot of work to do, but the synergies between both associations are vast and thus the collaboration makes perfect sense for most industry professionals,&#x201c; explains Otto. &#x201c;Our vision is to improve communication and the business relationships between TMCs and travel buyers. With ASATA&#x2019;s focus on the TMC community and ABTA&#x2019;s strong corporate following, combining our efforts to bring these two sectors together more regularly and encouraging meaningful interactions like the ABTA/ASATA focus group recently, will see that these objectives are far more likely to be reached,&#x201d; concludes Swart.
