&#x201c;We are so pumped to come back to South Africa. The shows in 2014 were unreal, the fans were incredible,&#x201d; said Mike Porra, Nitro Circus executive chairman and global head of creative. &#x201c;Now to have an opportunity to come back with Travis riding and with an all new show, this tour is going to be epic.&#x201d; &#x201c;I am so excited to finally have the chance to go to South Africa and ride for our fans there,&#x201d; said Pastrana. &#x201c;I was so disappointed that my broken leg sidelined me last time.
