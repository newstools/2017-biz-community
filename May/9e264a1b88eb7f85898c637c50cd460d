Trevor HillWith over 20 years of global experience with Audi, Hill joins the South African team after spending two years at the head office in Germany heading up the global strategic project of Internationalisation. Says Hill: &#x201c;Audi South Africa has a very robust and secure strategy. I will be looking to grow upon the good work done by my predecessor and ensure that at Audi South Africa, we deliver an excellent level of customer service. We have a modern and well-functioning dealer organisation which has invested heavily in the brand and I would hope to ensure that we can deliver on our promise to make Audi the number one brand franchise for investors.&#x201d; Hill holds a higher diploma in education (HdipED) from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, a certificate in motor vehicle retailing from the University of Cape Town, and an MBA from Anaheim University in California, USA.
