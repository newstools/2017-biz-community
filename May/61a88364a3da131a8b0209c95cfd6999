The See It Be It 2017 group with Sarah Watson and Awards Director Simon Cook Cannes Lions websiteThe dedicated programme includes specially designed creative masterclasses and workshops, an insider tour of the jury room, one-to-one mentoring with some of the industry&#x2019;s biggest names and exclusive networking events. The initiative was launched in 2014, when festival organisers identified a dramatic gender imbalance in its audience of middle and senior level creatives, reflecting the low numbers of women in upper levels of the industry globally. Fewer women involved in the creation process resulted in more gender-biased work, which perpetuated a cycle of objectification and maintained the low levels of female creative directors, which at the time was around 3%. &#x201c;See It Be It was launched to highlight talented creative women and accelerate their careers. This year&#x2019;s group come from all over the world and bring a wide range of experiences and strong leadership potential. They will be exposed to the best inspiration Cannes Lions has to offer, with exclusive mentoring sessions, workshops and a programme of events designed to extend and enhance their network,&#x201d; said Louise Benson, executive festival director, Lions Health, Lions Entertainment and eurobest and executive lead, See It Be It. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fitting that so many of our alumni have gone on to achieve success and having them involved in creating a shortlist from all of the applications this year enhanced the intense selection process. This community of women have gone on to become powerful role models for the next generation and we look forward to meeting this year&#x2019;s group.&#x201d; Participants:Adebola Adegbulugbe, copy group head, Insight Publicis, Nigeria - When not writing copy to help clients get amazing marketing results, she volunteers as a mentor for teenage girls with her group, Women Educating Girls, and writes inspirational and empowering articles.Atiya Zaidi, ECD, Synergy Dentsu, Pakistan &#x2013;
