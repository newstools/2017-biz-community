For over 22 years Andre held his audience spellbound with his dry wit, his spectacular sense of humor and his ability to get members of the public to do various strange, weird and entertaining routines on stage. His previous shows at GrandWest have been sellout successes. &#x201c;His shows are for everyone and even if you have seen him before, you are assured of seeing something entirely new every time. We can&#x2019;t wait for his shows at the Roxy Revue Bar,&#x201d; says Elouise Matthys, the PR and Promotions Manager at GrandWest. With shows at the Roxy Revue Bar nightly at 20:00 between Wednesday and Saturday and with matinees on Saturdays at 18:00 and Sundays at 15:00, audiences will have ample opportunity to catch Andre The Hilarious Hypnotist in action. Tickets are available at Computicket.
