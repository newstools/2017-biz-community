The TVC takes the form of a short film and seeks to demystify the Siemens brand for people who take technology that enables infrastructure for granted. &#x201c;This was a a purposeful shift away from corporate storytelling to create relatable human moments,&#x201d; says Keshin Govender, head of communications at Siemens Southern and Eastern Africa. &#x201c;We used a &#x2018;day in the life of&#x2019; story format of a man and a woman, and a narrator. The narrator &#x2013; the voice of Siemens &#x2013; is a third character in the story that the couple hear at certain points in the story,&#x201d; explains Graeme Jenner, ECD at King James II. &#x201c;The trick was getting that fine balance right, letting people know exactly how Siemens plays a role in their lives, but doing it in such a way that it adds to the story and doesn&#x2019;t detract.&#x201d; The film format has drama, comedy and an obligatory plot twist.
