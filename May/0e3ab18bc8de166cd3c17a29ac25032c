Cartoon Network&#x2019;s CN Buddy Network is a global anti-bullying campaign that started with Cartoon Network US and was then picked up by the EMEA region. CN Buddy Network was rolled out in Africa for the first time in 2016 in partnership with Childline and gold Olympic medallist and world record holder, Wayde van Niekerk. The aim of the campaign was to deliver a credible and informative message through the use of animation, video content and storytelling to raise awareness and inform kids about bullying, empowering them to speak out about their experiences and to be a buddy, not a bully. In 2016, Cartoon Network created some local flair with the re-launch of Cartoon Network&#x2019;s most enduring original series The Powerpuff Girls. The launch was executed through the channels&#x2019; strategic collaboration with South Africa&#x2019;s dynamic jazz-electro-hip-pop phenom, Toya Delazy, to represent the Powerpuff Girls on the African continent. To top it off, Turner scooped up another prestigious award at the 2017 African Excellence Awards winning a Gold African Excellence Award in the Content Marketing category for Cartoon Network&#x2019;s anti-bullying campaign, Be a Buddy not a Bully, with CN Buddy Network. Pierre Branco, VP and managing director of Turner Africa says: &#x201c;We here at Turner strive for excellence in everything that we do and constantly try to break boundaries in order to achieve great things.&#x201d;
