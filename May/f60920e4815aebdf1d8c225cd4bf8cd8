What is fake news you ask? Fake news is completely made up information, manipulated to resemble credible journalism and attract maximum attention and, with it, advertising revenue. Fake news is designed to deceive readers to maximise traffic and to make profit. Fake news can include websites that circulate distorted, decontextualised or dubious information. The Eventus International seminar, taking place on 23 August 2017 at the Southern Sun Elangeni Maharani in Durban, will be exploring fake news and whether it can be controlled. International keynote speaker, digital expert and CEO of DigitLab, Mike Saunders, will be facilitating this informative event. The Fake News seminar will define how fake news can negatively impact businesses and brands, divide society and affect our decision-making processes. This one-day seminar will teach you how to identify fake news stories and separate fictitious information from factual news. Learn how to control and prevent the spread of fake news, as well as how to respond in an effective manner to minimise the effects of fake news on your business and brand.
