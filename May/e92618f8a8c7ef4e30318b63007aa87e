Since early 2017 we have been providing Antalis with a full suite marketing solution across traditional and digital channels. Decimal Agency creative director, Jarred Leslie, expressed his enthusiasm to work with yet another international brand: &#x201c;As an agency we are honored to be doing work with a global brand that is known throughout the creative world of advertising.&#x201d; Antalis is one of the largest distributors of paper in the world. Apart from paper they also offer visual communication solutions, print equipment and consumables, and packaging and logistics solutions. As Jarred says, &#x201c;Upholding the tactile emotion is important in this ever evolving digital world.&#x201d; In a world that is becoming increasingly digital, paper as a medium has changed. Using paper to communicate is significant because it places something tangible in our hands instead of another screen. As a team of creatives, we at Decimal are constantly exploring new ways to communicate with people in a manner that is personal and affecting, so we&#x2019;re excited to come up with new ways to convey the message that choosing paper is a creative act. Since Antalis came on board as a client we have had the opportunity to work on their new product launches, new business development, internal marketing, business-to-business advertising, and web development. We look forward to building a lasting relationship with Antalis South Africa and we know that this partnership will take both companies to new creative heights.
