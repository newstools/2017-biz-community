CEO and founder, Matt Manners established the EE Awards in the UK mid 2014, to shine a light on the being done in engagement, whilst communicating to the boardroom the value it can deliver to employees and communities, as well as the bottom line. The business has evolved from purely recognition with Awards to education via best practice case studies and thought-leadership at its conferences around the world. These best practices will be shared online via the website www.ee-awards.com from June 2017. The EE Awards has worked with and seen finalists from companies such as BMW, Boeing, Cisco, Direct Line, Expedia, Ford, IBM, KPMG, Lloyds Bank, MasterCard, MetLife, Microsoft, PwC, Ralph Lauren, Slack, Visa, Virgin and more. African engagement Manners stated, &#x201c;Today is a landmark for The EE Awards. As we approach our third year anniversary, we have signed our first license agreement to launch on our fourth continent. This is an agreement that will take us to a part of the world where employee engagement can have an impact on the lives of workers. &#x201c;Landelahni&#x2019;s vision for the African EE Awards is inspiring and focused on delivering human impact through good practice in engagement, within all types of employers across the continent. The EE Awards model of recognition and education is based on local experiences and culturally relevant practices. We will be working closely with them to make year one a great success.&#x201d; Tricia Sibbons, COO, The African EE Awards, commented, &#x201c;We are delighted to be joining the global EE Awards family, which has established a practice and presence in the employee engagement sector. As we celebrate Africa Month here, we are confident that bringing African voices to this work will deepen engagement practice across the globe.&#x201d; To register interest in The 2017 African EE Awards & Conference in Johannesburg, go to www.ee-awards.com, ahead of the official opening of the African site in early June.
