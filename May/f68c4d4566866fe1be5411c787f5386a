GM, Dean Deary, said, &#x201c;Foot traffic has increased by 4% this year alone and that the 36,000 m2 mall had shown consistent year-on-year growth throughout its nine years. I am proud to see the investment and buy-in of our local community that has helped the centre reach this milestone. We have one vacancy left, which has been offered to a prospective tenant. &#x201c;This new addition will add to the already growing foot traffic and increased turnovers for our tenants, while delivering exciting, quality brands for our shoppers.&#x201d; Elevating Mdantsane Mdantsane-born entrepreneur Sakhumzi Klassen is the driving force behind the Wimpy initiative. The 41-year-old franchisee, who has various business interests in the former township area, believes the Wimpy franchise is a tangible sign of growing investor confidence by big brands in Mdantsane. &#x201c;Mdantsane is a very interesting place, and I would like to see it reach the levels of other similar townships such as Soweto. It is currently not at its rightful place socially, economically or from a growth point of view.&#x201d; Klassen said his latest venture would help to address this by creating 20 permanent jobs, with at least another five part-time openings depending on its stability and growth. &#x201c;We urge the community to come and support this business, as it will support more than 30 local families, if you also consider the suppliers who will benefit from it.&#x201d; For Klassen, the arrival of a brand like Wimpy has been a long time coming, as there are what he terms &#x2018;restro lounges&#x2019; in Mdantsane but no fast food restaurants offering seated dining. &#x201c;Customers can look forward to an experience on par with, or even better than, any other Wimpy in the suburbs. The location of the restaurant within the mall is stunning and I&#x2019;m sure customers are going to love it.&#x201d; Famous Brands&#x2019; managing executive for the Eastern Cape, Mark Hedderwick, said the Wimpy brand had evolved from a traditional &#x2018;breakfast and burger joint&#x2019; into a modernised, value-for-money restaurant with the addition of meat and chicken grills to the menu. &#x201c;Mdantsane Shopping Centre is the destination of choice for the local community, which affords us a great opportunity to &#x2018;take the brand to the people&#x2019;.&#x201d;
