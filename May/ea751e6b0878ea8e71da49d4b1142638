Originally launched in the U.S., the app hosts an array of practitioners including family physicians, paediatricians, dermatologists, dentists, mental health providers, nutritionists, dieticians and even veterinarians, providing a more convenient and modernised method of consultation to suit all healthcare needs. App users will receive a consultation receipt so that patients are able to claim back from their medical aid provider. Patients who aren't covered by a medical aid will also benefit from the app as a result of the consultation fee being significantly lower than traditional examinations. Partnerships Medici Africa has partnered with Dr Michael Mol and Hello Doctor, already servicing over 400,000 patients in SA today with their own panel of doctors. This partnership will create an integrated link between the two apps, allowing patients on Hello Doctor to consult with their own doctor via Medici and vice versa. Patients can speak to their existing family physician, who already has access to their full medical history and receive medical advice quickly and effectively. This innovation in healthcare technology is changing the face of healthcare and the way doctors and patients communicate. "South Africa gave me one of the most incredible foundations for life that I could have ever hoped for,&#x201d; says Clinton Phillips, founder and CEO of Medici, founder of 2nd.MD, and former chiropractor and rugby player from South Africa. &#x201c;Launching Medici in Africa is an incredible honour, it will change millions of lives and bring access to high-quality healthcare to patients and providers alike."
