The competition takes place from March to September and challenges chefs-in-training from culinary schools across the country to submit recipes, accompanied by gorgeous photography or video. Each month has its own theme and current/upcoming themes are: Baking (May), Low Carb (June), Chocolate (July) and Modern Braai (August). Tessa Purdon, Food24 editor says &#x201c;The aim of NextGen is to combine technology with talent. Food is eaten with the eyes first so we&#x2019;ve provided a platform for young chefs-in-training to not only create a recipe with a twist but also to produce content that allows the reader to almost &#x201c;taste&#x201d; the finished product. We&#x2019;ve provided guidelines, tips and tricks for creative submissions and so far we are receiving outstanding entries. All the recipes entries will be published to Food24 for readers to use and enjoy. Users can go here to see the Easter entries and here to see the recent baking entries. &#x201c;There is considerable talent in this country and as the biggest online foodie destination in South Africa with over 33,000 recipes, Food24 is honoured to be showcasing the next generation of award-winning chefs,&#x201d; adds Purdon. The recipes and visuals or videos will be judged by a panel of some of South Africa&#x2019;s top culinary stars and foodies including James Gaag (La Colombe), Peter Tempelhoff (The Collection), Sam Linsell (Drizzle and Dip food blog), Hope Malau (Drum Magazine&#x2019;s Food editor), Elke van Vledder (Marketing Manager Domestic Appliances Philips South Africa) and Tessa Purdon (Food24&#x2019;s Editor). The judging panel will select their top finalists each month and the overall winner will be announced at a ceremony later in the year. The entries will be judged on the following criteria: Originality (the recipe needs to be the entrant&#x2019;s own creation), knowledge and understanding of current world food trends, the costing of the recipe, execution and styling/photography skills or video flow. The competition is sponsored by Phillips and the top student will walk away with R45,000 worth of Phillips appliances and R15,000 cash prize. Phillips will also be awarding monthly prizes and a R30,000 Phillips hamper to the winning culinary school. Students can submit their entries here and read about the entry requirements here.
