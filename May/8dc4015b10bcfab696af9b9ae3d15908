Celebrities are assisted and supported by OFM presenters. Says OFM General Manager, Nick Efstathiou: "Celeb Radio is one of our most successful projects and we look forward to hosting some of South Africa's most popular presenters in studio every year. This year, we are thrilled to welcome Janina and Nianell to Central South Africa. Every year, Celeb Radio produces unique and exciting content. I am sure this year will be no different. Listeners can look forward to some great laughs and interviews, brought to you by two extremely well-liked celebrities." Janina Oberholzer, who will be on air from 5-9 June, is no stranger to radio. Her career started in 2006 at campus radio station Tuks FM, after which she moved to Jacaranda FM in 2008, first as traffic compiler for the Just Plain Breakfast and later as sports presenter on the Martin Bester Drive team. In Central South Africa, she is probably best known as co-presenter on Toks and Tjops with rugby heavyweights Toks van der Linde and Breyten Paulse. Nianell, who will host Celeb Radio from 12-15 June, is a platinum-selling musician and great friend of OFM. Her songs are not only played on South Africa radio stations, but also internationally. She quickly became a household name after the success of her debut album 'Who painted the moon?' She is also a SAMA winner and certainly one of the busiest singer-songwriters in South Africa.
