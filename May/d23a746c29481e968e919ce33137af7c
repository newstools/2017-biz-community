Now fans of the Scottish band, who grew up listening worldwide hits like Summer Son, I Don&#x2019;t Want a Lover, Say What You Want, Halo, Everyday Now and Tell Me Why, will get to sing along to these and other incredible songs when Texas performs live at Cape Town&#x2019;s Kirstenbosch Gardens on Friday, 8 December 2017 and Johannesburg&#x2019;s Emmarentia Gardens on Sunday, 10 December 2017. For over three decades, Texas has produced hit after hit and thrilled audiences around the globe. One of the longest touring bands in the industry, the release of Jump on Board this past April reintroduces the band to old fans and opens them up to a new market with singles like Let&#x2019;s Work It Out and Can&#x2019;t Control. Frontwomen Sharleen Spiteri&#x2019;s soulful and melodic voice remains an iconic testament to the band&#x2019;s longstanding success. Texas will be supported by local acts, who will be announced soon. Both concerts promise to be an unforgettable live music experience at two of the country&#x2019;s most beautiful outdoor venues. Tickets are now officially on sale for R495 through Webtickets and selected Pick &#x2019;n Pay stores. www.texas.uk.com Texas Live in South Africa is proudly brought to you by We Are Live.
