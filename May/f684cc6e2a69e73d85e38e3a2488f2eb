The company declared a dividend of R3.78 per share, an increase of 4% from the previously comparable period. Group operating profit was up 10% to R2.2bn. The company said a strong domestic performance was partially diluted by "tough trading conditions in exports" and its international business, coupled with a "decline in income from associates". Group turnover from continuing operations increased 7% to R16.4bn. The company overall volumes declined 3% attributing its growth in turnover to, in part, an increase in prices. Source: BDpro
