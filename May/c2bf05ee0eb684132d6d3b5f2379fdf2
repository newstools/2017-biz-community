On the judging panel was some of South Africa&#x2019;s most respected B-Boys. Last year&#x2019;s winner Brandon &#x2018;The Curse&#x2019; Petersen, B-Boy Vouks, international Red Bull BC All Star Neguin, B-Boy Benny who has represented South Africa at the event&#x2019;s World Finals on multiple occasions and local B-Boy legend, Ramone whittled down the B-Boy contestants. Neguin was impressed with the local breaking scene on his first visit: &#x201c;South Africa has such great talent. All the guys in tonight&#x2019;s final have such good skills with great potential. The future of the local scene looks bright, especially if you look at talent like B-Boy Toufeeq who made it to the semi-final round.&#x201d; In the final, the atmosphere was electric as B-Boy Bashi from Johannesburg and B-Boy Meaty, who hails from Eerste River, went one-on-one, break by break. Ultimately Meaty brought out his best moves to win the battle. World final in Amsterdam on November Commenting on Meaty&#x2019;s win Neguin said: &#x201c;Meaty is very confident in himself and very connected to the music. A lot of the other B-Boys tonight focused on their opponent but Meaty focused on himself. That&#x2019;s what gave him the edge. I see a lot of myself in Meaty.&#x201d; The Red Bull BC One South Africa Cypher was the culmination of a host of festivities to nurture and support local breaking talent. Seventy B-Boys and B-Girls tried out for the last few spots in the main event on Thursday and spent time learning from Neguin who won the international event in 2010 on Friday. B-Boy Meaty will head to Amsterdam in November where he has a chance at winning a spot in the Red Bull BC One World Final.
