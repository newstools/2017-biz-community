Shortcut to escaping EscEscape is a free-to-install extension for Google Chrome users. When a user taps their keyboard &#x2018;Esc&#x2019; key twice, a live flight search runs to find the cheapest, quickest and smartest return flights to nearby destinations. Results are pulled from Cheapflights&#x2019; own search engine API and the users&#x2019; nearest airport is detected as their departure airport. The flight results open in a new browser tab and will be the cheapest option for a weekend break in the next eight weeks. The user is then free to go ahead and book if they like the look of what they see &#x2013; if not, another &#x2018;double tap&#x2019; of the Esc key throws up a new option. &#x201c;We want people to rediscover their &#x2018;Esc&#x2019; key, and make it their shortcut to escaping for real - double tap quick,&#x201d; comments Andrew Shelton, Cheapflights&#x2019; managing director. Initially, a choice of five destinations will be featured each day, selected at random from the top 200 searched-for holiday hot spots on the Cheapflights website and app, per market. For the UK, US, Canada, and South Africa, only flights within a five-hour flight time are selected. For flights departing from Australia and New Zealand, flights within an eight-hour flight time are selected, giving people popular getaway destinations such as Fiji. Shelton continues, &#x201c;We can spend hours every day tapping away at a keyboard, dealing with dozens of unread emails, thinking it's Thursday when it&#x2019;s only Tuesday. According to our research, that&#x2019;s enough to drive over half of us to search for flights when we&#x2019;re at work. &#x201c;With EscEscape, we&#x2019;ve made that much easier to do. We want this neglected keyboard function to become the biggest and most important key people tap each day.&#x201d; The extension is available for free from today from the Chrome Web Store. A version of the extension for Safari users is planned shortly.
