&#x201c;At DStv, we&#x2019;re always looking for ways to excite and engage our customers. It&#x2019;s all about creating real-time experiences that are fun and engaging; and DStv Delicious does just that! Food channels come to life; kids get to interact with their favourite characters and much-loved celebrities mingle with our valued customers&#x201d; commented Nomsa Chabeli general manager for marketing at DStv. Due to the overwhelming success of last year&#x2019;s event, it will be held at the same venue with the same format of over two days. Internationally recognised, Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit is a world class facility and centrally located for easy access. Entry to the venue is easy with its nine entry and exit points for hassle-free movement. &#x201c;This year our aim is to surpass the success of 2016, which itself enjoyed exceptional public support due to the world-class quality of the international and local acts, the high standard of local chefs, the enticing gourmet food market and the hugely popular Kids Zone,&#x201d; says Lloyd Cornwall, Festival Director of the DStv Delicious Festival. &#x201c;The festival is a highlight of the gastronomical year due to its eclectic entertainment and fusions of foods that please all tastes, whether traditional or contemporary.&#x201d; Cornwall describes the DStv Delicious International Food and Music Festival &#x201c;as a unique opportunity for Corporate South Africa to associate their brand with what is the biggest and most influential lifestyle event in South Africa&#x201d;. It is also DStv&#x2019;s flagship lifestyle property, enjoying millions of rand&#x2019;s worth of exposure across the DStv platforms in South Africa and many African territories. &#x201c;The event and the media/marketing opportunities surrounding the event have grown exponentially over the last five years. The huge growth of satisfied festival patrons is testament to our unique recipe. The main components of its success include: international and local artists on a main stage, international and local chefs featured in various pop-up restaurants and cooking theatres, channel activations, brand activations, an interactive kids zone, South Africa&#x2019;s biggest gourmet street food market, and a world class dance arena. &#x201c;The festival has built up enormous loyalty over the years. It is a marketing occasion not to be missed,&#x201d; says Cornwall.
