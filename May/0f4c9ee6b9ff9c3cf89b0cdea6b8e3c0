The partnership will see AutoZone offer Unity&#x2019;s vehicle warranties, accident, scratch & dent, and tyre & rim cover under the brand name, AutoZone Protect. The vehicle warranties offering covers over 31 major mechanical and electrical components. The accident cover insures the policyholder, as well as up to five dependent children up to the age of 21, or 25-years-old if they are full-time, registered students, for accidental death and disability. The scratch & dent policy covers minor chips, dents and light scratches on the body of the vehicle. Tyre & rim cover ensures that if the policyholder&#x2019;s tyres and/or rims are damaged accidentally by potholes, they&#x2019;ll be repaired or replaced.
