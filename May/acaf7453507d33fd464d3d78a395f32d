Providing a service is a personal and ongoing interaction &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t end when the customer accepts your advice, quote or completed job. To be truly engaged as a service provider you need to know that it&#x2019;s not about the money but the communication, the customer satisfaction and the power of retention. And you&#x2019;re not going to get any of that if you bombard, bewilder or bully clients into taking the wrong package (i.e.: the most expensive) or assuming you know what&#x2019;s best. The service industry is about looking at the process from your client's point of view: what is it that they want and what do they need to get there? what is their budget? gradually seeking to understand the extent of their knowledge of the process advising what is best according to their situation leaving the choices ultimately to your client because no matter how much you think you know they want, you are not in their shoes, in their position or in that company. Service is about advice, empathy and the sharing of information.</li></li></li></li></li>Communication Service should serve the interest of the customer. So, listening is a good place to start. Only once you clearly understand the needs of your client, are you able to make recommendations. The trick is not to make decisions difficult for them by adding an array of new elements to the conversation, but to rather give them their best realistic options in line with their budget. And to be clear about your message without resorting to jargon that the customer may not be familiar with. It&#x2019;s good to get a grasp of the business goals of the organisation you are preparing to serve. If you glean more of where they are moving their strategy and how they see their business growth, you will know how to offer solutions that align with their strategy &#x2013; and how to ensure flexibility in approach and delivery. Never tell a client something cannot be done &#x2013; rather offer to investigate possibilities and come back with perhaps a slightly different idea &#x2013; but still a choice that remains viable, innovative and practical within the client&#x2019;s framework of need. This kind of dedicated customer service requires nifty footwork, always a positive outlook &#x2013; and that other rather odd emotion called love. Empathy This is truly one of the most difficult &#x2013; and perhaps even rare &#x2013; emotions in just ordinary life let alone business. We don&#x2019;t potter about all day, wondering how our clients are feeling. But we should at least be at pains to understand their position when they rush in with an awkward request &#x2013; sometimes even a demand. How you react depends on how much you care, how much you can align your feelings with theirs. And sometimes, to be honest, you may well start the engagement at the opposite ends of the rainbow. But caring means love in a way that lets you feel the emotion of your client when they have been put in a position that calls for them to pull a rabbit out of the hat for their manager, and who then, sometimes in desperation, call upon you to help them. That is when &#x2018;can do&#x2019; kicks into action &#x2013; an action that can only be taken to its utmost limits when you care, when you can feel that other person&#x2019;s need and can fully comprehend their vision. And when you reach that point then you truly know what it means to love to serve. The bugbear of budgets At the endgame of all interactions, negotiations, advice and proposals lies the problem of the client&#x2019;s budget. Respect it. Even if your client doesn&#x2019;t really know what they can spend, they invariably know what they can&#x2019;t. Be honest in all engagements &#x2013; so that they are fully aware what certain decisions may cost them. Also, be clear about what they may lose if they look for solutions that are too cheap, too cost-focused to be effective. There&#x2019;s no harm in explaining that delicate aspect &#x2013; but you still have to work with your client to find a middle ground. You need to examine what can be done within their constraints &#x2013; and then, even more importantly, how far innovation can go beyond that: where are the discounts, the best deals, the clever corners to cut? How can you make this work in the best way for your client without forcing them into high budget spend discomfit? They say the best sales people always find that extra &#x2018;twist&#x2019; of service that may intrigue and delight the customer. When a client knows you&#x2019;re there with the same consideration for their budget as they have, they become your high retention clients because they trust your honesty and your personal approach. Money talks &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s the one language where nothing should be lost in translation. Exploring new avenues At Ayanda Mbanga Communications we treat every job with fresh perspective, every client as an individual. There&#x2019;s no one size fits all about us. We nurture an attitude of &#x2018;can do&#x2019; that is not about our viewpoint but how we can adapt to each new request with an open mind, inspiration and confidence. The &#x2018;extra mile&#x2019; is territory many companies prefer to leave unexplored while forcing a pre-set product or package on the client. We believe you cannot have &#x2018;can do&#x2019; and not explore that extra mile. Sometimes it takes us into uncharted seas and we like that. The spirit of &#x2018;can do&#x2019; stretches our capability and hones our skills so that ultimately what we can do, becomes unlimited.
