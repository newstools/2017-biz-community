In addition, 51.4% already use both public and private cloud infrastructure resources with an additional 29.2% expecting to in the next year.* The survey results, published in the IDC white paper, The Power of Hybrid Cloud, also reveal that total cost of ownership is one of the top drivers of cloud adoption. Other criteria for future IT infrastructure decisions on workloads supported by cloud environments includes physical and data security (34%) and operation flexibility (33%) in addition to the flexibility of economic models. This study underscores the value of turnkey hybrid cloud, which balances the pros and cons of different cloud deployment models. *IDC white paper, sponsored by Dell EMC, The Power of Hybrid Cloud, May 2017
