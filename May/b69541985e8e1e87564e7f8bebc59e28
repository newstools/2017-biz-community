Strand Beach Sea PointThe present building occupying the site is a perfect example of where the design philosophy favoured function over form, says Paul Berman. &#x201c;The fa ade of the current building is being carefully demolished as it had little to no aesthetic or heritage value and, critically for this part of Cape Town, its aspect takes poor advantage of the spectacular views of Lions Head and the endless Atlantic below.&#x201d; The new Strand Beach Sea Point has been designed to balance luxury and contemporary appeal. &#x201c;Tasked with this undertaking, InHouse Brand Architects, working with MLB, have been mandated to create a modern, classic, and sophisticated look with timeless appeal that will transform the building from being merely an outdated apartment block to becoming attractive homes in a modern setting,&#x201d; says Berman. Cosmopolitan suburb Run by brothers Paul and Saul Berman, BBG has over 22 years&#x2019; experience in property development, focusing most of their attention on the Atlantic Seaboard. Sea Point is particularly special to BBG as the brothers grew up in this cosmopolitan suburb and have strong connections to the neighbourhood and community. &#x201c;Sea Point has enjoyed a very successful renaissance over the last 10 years. Testament to this is the remarkable increase in both commercial and residential property values on the back of a safer and cleaner urban environment, and strategic property developments in the vibrant business strip such as The Point Mall &#x2013; a BBG and HCI Properties rejuvenation - which has attracted a variety of new businesses in the vicinity and boosted the local micro-economy,&#x201d; says Berman.
