Says head of MAN Bus & Coach sales, Philip Kalil-Zackey: "The new generation of Lion's Explorer buses is clearly integrated into the family of MAN Lion's buses available to customers around the globe. We are very proud as team South Africa to build a bus locally which clearly has evolved in its aesthetic appearance, and no doubt will become a welcome addition to the hundreds of vehicles deployed so successfully over the last decade or so." New features New features include fuel consumption reducing aerodynamics, with LED style day-time running lights enhancing the European elegance of the new styling.
