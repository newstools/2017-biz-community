The national Golf TV&#x2122; network is now available not only in the clubhouse but also in the golf cart as part of the on-cart GPS system, offering advertisers another key touchpoint for capturing the attention of this affluent audience. Golf TV&#x2122; in-cart is a highly engaging and interactive tool for golfers whilst playing their game. Players interact with the touch screen as the game progresses thus increasing brand visibility and assimilation. The full-screen advertisement requires a touch action to exit and continue play. Simon Turck, MD of Golf Ads&#x2122;, explains that the company continues to innovate in the golfing environment to enhance the game for players whilst providing advertisers with key touchpoints for effective engagement and assimilation. &#x201c;Golfers are a highly sought-after consumer bracket. They are affluent, influential decision-makers who are interested in luxury goods, high-end services and FMCG products that fit with their lifestyle. But to reach this consumer, innovation and relevance is key. With the acquisition of these exclusive rights for the screens in golf carts, Golf TV&#x2122; is able to target the absolute top end of the golf environment with many of the courses situated within exclusive golf courses and estates. The platform gives marketers the opportunity to engage with these golfers in what can only be described as exceptionally long dwell time in a totally uncluttered environment,&#x201d; says Turck. National reach and impact With Golf TV&#x2122; in-cart, each advertiser slot reaches the network of 2,500 Golf Carts across 45 golf courses nationally. An audience reach of over 100,000 players use this facility and are exposed to advertising at a high frequency, whilst playing the game every month. Add to this the Golf TV&#x2122; screens within the clubhouses and it&#x2019;s a winning formula. Key benefits include exclusive branding opportunities Golf TV&#x2122; has a number of highly sought-after key benefits. The platform offers unavoidable exposure, effective targeting with national footprint across high-value courses and reaches a captive audience experiencing significant dwell time. It is effective with little wastage as it is low on production costs with a quick turn-around. With heavy investment by clubs and estates in the latest technology units, coupled with the fact that Golf TV&#x2122; is part of Golf Ads&#x2122;, advertisers can take advantage of a more integrated range of exclusive branding opportunities. &#x201c;For advertisers wanting to reach this consumer, the golfing environment should be a key component of the marketing strategy. And with the extension of Golf TV&#x2122; into golf carts, the potential for assimilation and recall increases exponentially,&#x201d; concludes Turck. About Golf Ads&#x2122; Impact. Unique media.
