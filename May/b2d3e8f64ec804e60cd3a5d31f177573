Additional schools that will benefit from the 2017 outreach initiative include Pula Difate Primary School, Koos Matle Primary School, Sikhanyisile Primary School, Nantes Primary School and Norridge Primary School. &#x201c;The DSP has shown forward thinking by integrating robotics into its curriculum. In previous years, successful robotics teams presented South Africa at the World Robot Olympiad, both nationally and internationally. Bosch is honoured to continue support for the DSP&#x2019;s robotics lab which further benefits outreach communities,&#x201d; said Dr Markus Thill, president Bosch Region Africa. The recent inclusion of identified outreach schools is just in time, as the learners prepare for 2017 Gauteng Explorer Competition, which is scheduled to take place in August 2017. &#x201c;We are very pleased to make robotics accessible to more learners from communities outside of the DSP community. This outreach initiative certainly empowers the next generation of Africans to invent their future,&#x201d; says Warren Markley, head of robotics at the DSP. Robotics was introduced at DSP in 2010 and is available to learners from kindergarten to high school, offering increasing levels of complexity. Kindergarten learners start out by building robots with Lego robotics kits, and then gradually progress to solving technical challenges such as having their robots play soccer or navigate on uneven terrain. At a more advanced level, the youth learn programming skills. In 2015, Bosch sponsored the Lego robotics kits, learners&#x2019; competition shirts, and supported the recent refurbishment of the lab facilities. Bosch is committed to fostering young talent in Africa and is the initiator of &#x2018;Afrika Kommt!&#x2019;, a programme for budding business leaders from the continent, sponsored by German industry leaders. Scholarships are offered to junior executives, who get to spend one year in Germany completing professional training at German companies.
