The company has been adding global reach to its network in support of increasing real-time web, app, and API content delivery traffic. The company helps digital businesses &#x2013; such as Airbnb, The New York Times, and Ticketmaster &#x2013; keep pace with their customer expectations by delivering secure and scalable real-time experiences. &#x201c;We realise the importance and the benefits of a content delivery network (CDN) deploying in our market, particularly in terms of improved quality and cost reduction. Major CDNs like Fastly&#x2019;s offering add enormous potential to the development of the local market as a whole. Workonline Communications is committed to providing the best for Africa as well as to developing the African market in every way possible. We are excited to be involved in the launch of Fastly in Africa,&#x201d; says Workonline&#x2019;s director of business development, Edward Lawrence. An essential tool CDNs are an essential tool to successfully conduct business online, as the internet was not originally built to handle the demands of massive amounts of data, live HD video, flash sales, and large downloads that have now become the standard. CDNs ensure that the internet works better, delivering media at scale, and enabling a better experience for the end user. &#x201c;Our collaboration with the teams at Workonline and Teraco enabled Fastly to quickly deploy a Fastly MegaPOP into Johannesburg. Our expanded reach reduces latency, improves performance, and enables a more robust user experience in South Africa and neighbouring countries. We feel that this is a win-win-win for the internet ecosystem of South Africa,&#x201d; says Tom Daly, vice president of infrastructure at Fastly.
