A third of these are new faces &#x2013; fresh talents and young entrepreneurs who have been mentored and nurtured to take a well-deserved space &#x2013; for the first time &#x2013; at the Cape Town show. Simply put &#x2013; there is nothing like Kamers/Makers in South Africa &#x2013; no platform that, on such a consistently successfully scale, allows artisan producers to showcase their wares, meet new customers and network with other creative souls in a supportive and fertile environment. In this year of &#x2018;Making Good&#x2019; the organisers have structured a number of initiatives aimed at spreading the power of the Kamers/Makers platform further and deeper into the communities in which we operate. Kamers/Makers will continue their successful partnership with Absa in creating a seamless, cash-free shopping experience at their shows. Absa will be showcasing some real banking innovations at the Castle of Good Hope, all aimed at making shopping a whole lot easier for everyone. Making good in the broader small business community This year Kamers/Makers have also launched Mzanzi Makers &#x2013; an NPO started in concert with some leading lights from the business world. Its aim is to identify creative entrepreneurs from disadvantaged backgrounds and to offer them an intensive mentoring and upskilling programme that will culminate in them also taking a deserved space on the Kamers/Makers circuit. Here at the shows, Kamers/Makers will continue to assist them in building real, viable brands and businesses like many of the &#x2018;makers&#x2019; have so successfully done over the years.
