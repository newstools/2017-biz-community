With access to proper sanitary wear, young women don&#x2019;t have to miss school during their menstrual cycle, as has been happening previously.&#x201d; Project Dignity forms the non-profit extension of Subz Pants and Pads, an organisation founded by Sue Barnes, which seeks to improve the lives of school-going girls by donating sponsored packs of reusable, eco-friendly sanitary pads and accompanying panties. The organisation was established after Barnes learned about the negative educational impact a lack of sanitary products is having on thousands of schoolchildren. Developed, designed and manufactured by Barnes, the Subz pads are made of five layers of hydrophilic fabric, which makes them absorbent to prevent leakage. Together with the 100% cotton panties, they are patented and have an SABS absorbency approval.

For March 2017, Clicks worked with Project Dignity to distribute 1,000 of the packs to schoolgirls in six schools based in Molweni, KwaZulu-Natal. The Girls on the Go campaign is set to continue for a further three years.
