The winners of ACF 2017 will be announced during a live final evaluation panel on 7 June during the Africa Energy Forum in Copenhagen. This year&#x2019;s finalists will once again be evaluated and scored by an independent panel of industry experts comprising senior representatives from Power Africa, InfraCo Africa, Proparco, the Dutch Development Bank (FMO) and Access Power who will provide Access Power with recommendations on the commercial, technical, social and environmental viability of each project based on a host of market, regulatory, environmental and economic factors.

Once these are successfully concluded, Access Power will take an equity stake in those projects and commence independently funding their third-party development costs such as feasibility studies, grid studies, environmental and social impact assessments and due diligence fees. Reda El Chaar, executive chairman, Access Power commented, &#x201c;The submissions to this year&#x2019;s ACF are a true representation of the amazing potential of Africa&#x2019;s growing renewable energy industry and the capable entrepreneurs driving it forward. It remains Access Power&#x2019;s mission to provide these important projects with a fast route to market, no matter what the location.&#x201d; &#x201c;Last year&#x2019;s ACF set the bar high as we received nearly 100 submissions from over 25 countries across the full spectrum of renewable technologies, a 75% increase on the previous edition. We encourage all renewable energy entrepreneurs to submit their projects for a chance to partner with us, and join us in progressing Africa&#x2019;s energy revolution.&#x201d;
