Engen Driver Wellness is a mobile health awareness initiative run by Thubelihle Occupational Health & Wellness. The initiative which has impacted positively on the country&#x2019;s bulk truck driver operators has continued to increase driver participation in voluntary screenings and improved health scores over the years. Free, voluntary screenings Operated nationwide at Engen Truck Stops and retail service stations, drivers are offered free, voluntary screenings in mobile clinics. These are conducted by qualified nurses and councillors where blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, tuberculosis, BMI (Body Mass Index), and HIV/AIDS are tested. Engen&#x2019;s corporate social investment manager, Mntu Nduvane says that the main aim of this initiative is to improve health through awareness. &#x201c;Education helps to remind drivers and our employees why their health is important and how life choices impact on their well-being. Ultimately this increases their health, safety and productivity.&#x201d; &#x201c;There has been a marked increase in a number of individuals using the services we provide which is a clear indication that this intervention is making a difference to the wellbeing of drivers and will ultimately lead to a healthier industry,&#x201d; adds Nduvane.
