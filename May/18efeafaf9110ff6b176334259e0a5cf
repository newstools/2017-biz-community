Aris Beis, Marianna Theyse, Nicci Robertson, Ambassador Kouvaritakis and Katri Katerina His Excellency the Greek Ambassador Eleftherios Kouvaritakis from the Johannesburg Embassy commented: &#x201c;Greek kiwifruits are exported to more than 50 countries worldwide. In South Africa, we have witnessed a significant increase of Greek kiwifruit exports in most recent years. From a mere R700,000 total value to a peak of R10m.&#x201d; &#x201c;According to preliminary estimations, for 2017, the cultivated kiwifruit hectares' were more than 85,000 with a total expected production of 205,000 tonnes. Up till April 2017, 105,000 tonnes had already been exported,&#x201d; said Kouvaritakis. Agronomist Katri Katerina stated a vitally important aspect: &#x201c;Greek kiwis are free of pesticide residues, as cultivation in Greece does not require their use.&#x201d; Kiwi Gold &#x201c;Kiwis fruits contain some of the highest concentration of vitamin C. In addition, they contain some of the highest natural levels of digestive enzymes that enable protein assimilation. An important aspect is that kiwi seeds are an excellent source of fibre,&#x201d; said Nutritionist Nicci Robertson. Hello Kiwi set to change trade relations between SA and GreeceCurrently, South Africa exports fresh fruit to Greece while Greece only exports processed fruit and vegetables to South Africa, but the European Union's Hello Kiwi' programme is set to change the situation...12 Apr 2017 The newest variety of kiwifruit on the market is the Kiwi Gold. &#x201c;Yellow or Gold kiwi fruit are regarded as nutritionally superior due to higher levels of vitamin C, E, and potassium - improving iron absorption. Yellow phytonutrients are a source of carotenoids and lutein. Protecting the eyes, heart and immune system,&#x201d; said Robertson. The fruit growing seasons in the two countries Greece and South Africa complement each other and create mutual benefits. Greece is implementing a roadmap for stabilising the national economy for sustainable growth, which makes it an ideal trading partner.
