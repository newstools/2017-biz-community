Afrima has been able to mobilise millions of people and renowned artistes from the five regions of Africa. &#x201c;We wish to thank Afrima for allowing us to popularise this continent policy tool on its platforms and we call upon all of you here present to assist in popularising these continental tools.&#x201d; Afrima is a combined effort to recognise, award, promote and preserve Africa&#x2019;s rich music culture. In partnership with the African Union, it is expected to be the biggest music event in Africa. For more information, click here.
