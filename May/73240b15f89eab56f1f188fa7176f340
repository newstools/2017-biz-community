Our latest commission was for Ricoffy&#x2019;s latest TVC to re-record Sipho Hotstix Mabuse&#x2019;s classic Burnout. The brief from agency Boomtown was to rearrange the track to enhance the narrative of the commercial. "I was thrilled when this job came in," says Adam Howard. "I&#x2019;ve performed with Hotstix many times in my career and love his music. This project gave me the opportunity and the honour to rearrange his music. We&#x2019;ve heard he loves the track!" The storyboard involved rendering a couple of sad human moments, resolving to a contemporary version of the classic to which Adam added brass for sparkle. Timothy Moloi delivered supreme performance vocals, as always. The spot is directed by Tebogo Malope of Bomb Commercials. Watch the ad below...
