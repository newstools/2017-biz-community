When Decimal was founded by MD Raffaele Mc Creadie in 2013, Soviet was one of our first clients. During our time together we helped Soviet branch out to become more accessible to a larger audience and grow their customer base. By the end of our contract Soviet had opened 18 stores across the country, 50% of which we assisted to launch and provided artwork for. The team at Decimal Agency are proud to have presented several campaigns for the denim brand. Some of our favourites include &#x2018;Real People, Real Denim&#x2019;, &#x2018;A Technicolour Denim Affair&#x2019;, the Miss SA Style File and the launch of Jolt Jeans. "Real People, Real Denim" was the new brand payoff line that we came up with for Soviet. The new payoff was well received and is still in use on selected campaigns to this day. We had the fantastic opportunity to work with the Miss South Africa 2016 contestants on the &#x2018;A Technicolour Denim Affair&#x2019; campaign, which featured high impact colourful visual effects and showed off Soviet&#x2019;s vibrant brand. Liesl Laurie, the 2016 Miss SA winner, was honoured with her own special line of Soviet fashion. To promote the new line we produced a video - Soviet Miss SA Style File - which was strategically placed in cinemas across the country. Lastly, the launch for Jolt Jeans was another shining moment for the Decimal/Soviet partnership. Because Jolt Jeans, a super stretch denim product, look great from any angle we gave away a free selfie stick with every purchase so that buys could photograph themselves from any angle, which gained favourable attention on social media. Along with this we produced a video contrasting a BMX rider and a ballet dancer to show that Jolt Jeans respond to the body&#x2019;s demands in almost any situation. Now that our tenure is over, we wish Soviet all the best in their marketing efforts and our door is always open if they need help on a killer creative campaign in the future.
