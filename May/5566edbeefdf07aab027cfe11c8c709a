Requirements &#x201c;Aspiring Clicks Cover Models need to have good skin, a beautiful smile and a healthy, fit body,&#x201d; says Andrea Baptista, director of D&A Model Management. &#x201c;We are looking for an outgoing individual with exceptional confidence. She needs to be a great speaker and witty conversationalist, with a sparkle in her eyes.&#x201d; Entrants need to upload three colour photos of themselves. Baptista advises the following tips to make an entry stand out: Make sure you are in a place with good lighting and that your photographs are not taken at an awkward angle. There should be no distractions, such as other people crowding the photo. Because we are looking for a natural beauty, wear subtle and minimal make-up, and remember to smile.
