In 2016 our editors published over 150 Cannes-related articles on our front pages to be archived in the Cannes Lions Special Section. For the third year in a row, Ann Nurock has been invited to attend Cannes as the industry media correspondent. In 2016 Ann&#x2019;s coverage included a total of nine exclusive interviews and articles and received unanimously positive feedback from industry, sponsors and partners, and we&#x2019;re feeling privileged to have Nurock on the ground at Cannes again in 2017. This year&#x2019;s coverage will be on trends that emerge such as industry revenue models, purpose-led marketing, stand-out individuals and brands and other key 2017 themes. June also happens to be Youth Month on Bizcommunity and we&#x2019;ll be tying in interviews and images from the award-winning SA Cinemark/Cannes Young Lions from 99C, who will also be attending the event, with a daisy-fresh perspective on Cannes. Standby for Case studies from Cannes 2017 As exclusive online media partner in collaboration with Cinemark, Bizcommunity and Ann Nurock will once again present a post-Cannes round up of key industry themes, winners and trends in Cape Town and Gauteng centres. This year promises to be even more exciting with three South African jury chairs having been invited to give their feedback at the presentations.
