&#x201c;We took a simple approach. We tapped into what consumers are attracted to &#x2013; pretty, glossy ads &#x2013; and led them through the 360 journey of consumerism via the Facebook 360 degree ad format,&#x201d; adds Ryan McManus, ECD Native VML. &#x201c;Every day we&#x2019;re bombarded with ads telling us to buy things that we don&#x2019;t need, and we choose to turn a blind eye to the full picture behind the purchases we make. The truth is that while manufacturing costs are dropping; the human and environmental impact has increased considerably.&#x201d; By utilising Facebook&#x2019;s 360 technology, the manufacturing cycle of three industry sectors namely fashion, mobile communications and chocolate are highlighted by allowing viewers of the ad to explore what looks to be a regular ad, but which reveals the true journey of a product, which often involves the exploitation of human and environmental rights.
