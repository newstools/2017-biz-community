Image Source: African Agri CouncilLand restitution Steven Grootes got the ball rolling by saying that the aims of land restitution had to be articulated in order for the plan to work. &#x201c;One needs to know what it means, why it needs to be done and how it has to be done.&#x201d; Roelf said that the one thing that there is absolutely dispute about was &#x201c;that the issue is real, it matters to people and to my mind it is not only about agricultural land, but also about urban land. Milaan made a passionate point that &#x201c;90% of successful commercial farmers are willing to go into partnership with black farmers to help them.&#x201d; While the DG said that the process has been plagued by a lack of capacity and general knowledge about farming. &#x201c;The people implementing the process did not know what they were doing. Farming is a gut thing, it is about passion, that is why a farmer wakes up at 3am to check his land.&#x201d; He said government was actively creating a farmer&#x2019;s register so that a reliable database could be established and so that the various stakeholders in government departments could work together from a collective approach to ensure the success of black farmers. Nchocho asked the question as to why land reform had to be a divisive issue, &#x201c;we need to approach it as a mechanism to bring us together, instead of pushing us apart.&#x201d; Milaan added that white commercial farmers had to make an effort to get to know their black counterparts on grass roots level, &#x201c;so that we can help each other.&#x201d; Continued dialogue necessary The DG said that continued dialogue was necessary and that &#x201c;platforms like Nation in Conversation had to happen more often and regularly to bring the different perspectives of the different stakeholders to the fore.&#x201d; In the end, regular show host Theo Vorster asked agri-newbie Derek Watts what he took from the discussion and he said: &#x201c;Even though I have been hosting Carte Blanche for many years I&#x2019;m not always up to date with developments in agriculture, however, I can genuinely say that I have a better insight into the issues and feel very positive about the future of agriculture.&#x201d;
