Listings Much effort was put into refining listings in the 2017 Most surveys for both media owners and media agencies. This was done through consultation with industry experts and with participating companies. All companies that received less than 10 votes in 2016 have been removed from the listings, however, respondents are free to add and vote for any companies that are not listed by using the &#x2018;other&#x2019; option in the survey, specifying the name of the organisation and then inputting the criteria scores. Media agency survey (completed by media owners) The media agencies listings have been segmented into three main categories in 2017: Full-service media agencies &#x2013; defined as companies that offer their own in-house media planning and media buying service across more than one media category.Traditional specialist media agencies &#x2013; defined as companies that offer their own in-house media planning or media buying service for more than one media category.Category specialist media agencies - defined as companies that offer their own in-house media planning and/or media buying service for one media category only (for example an out-of-home specialist agency, digital specialist agency, etc.).Media owner survey (completed by media agencies) A new category was introduced to the MOST Awards in 2016, the Media Sales Consultants category. A media sales consultancy is defined as an advertising media sales company that does not own the media brand/s that it sells and/or does not exclusively sell the brand/s that it represents. Most Awards sheep The Media Sales Consultants category has grown from eight companies listed in 2016 to 15 companies listed in 2017 and is now one of the most competitive categories. In 2016, it was specified that this was not a &#x2018;mainstream&#x2019; category and winners would not be considered for the overall award. In 2017 winners of the Media Consultancy Award will qualify for the overall media owner or &#x2018;Golden Sheep Award&#x2019; provided they receive the usual minimum of 30 votes. Voting for the ninth annual Most Awards opened last week and will continue until Friday, 30 June 2017. This year the winners will be announced on Thursday, 14 September 2017 at The Wanderers Club in Illovo, Johannesburg. For more information, go to the voting survey.
