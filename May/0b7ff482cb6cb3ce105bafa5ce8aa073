Starting her career in local production as a video editor, director, and scriptwriter, Jeanette then moved to the UK, where she was an assistant producer and content writer on a live music show called The Pulse. Her time in London afforded her valuable work experience &#x2013; specifically in live television, webcasting, and digital copywriting. Upon her return to South Africa, Jeanette further extended her portfolio by working in the corporate communications industry, which gave her first-hand experience in political, cultural, environmental, and social communication. In November 2012, after freelancing for a few years, Jeanette accepted a permanent position as senior copywriter at OgilvyOne (now Gloo@Ogilvy). She moved to Quirk as content director in September 2015, and was soon promoted to creative group head. Jeanette is passionate about good content, and describes herself as a storyteller, writer, and ideas person. She is fluent in four languages and has the depth of knowledge and experience to lead social and content teams in telling a brand's story online. "Social media should never be an afterthought. It is an intrinsic part of any brand's communication, and a useful platform before, during, and after a campaign," she said.
