A lot of time, effort and money goes into these sorts of things and more often than not there is no budget to speak of. Well done to all involved, it&#x2019;s a piece of work you can all be very proud of. P.S.: You can buy me a piece of cheesecake sometime.&#x201d; A special mention for the month also went to SPCA&#x2019;s Get This by Anton Visser at Patriot for Direction Craft, which shows that you can choose your best friend but not your family. "The performances of the leads are dry, funny and real and the contrast between them and the characters that are introduced to the scenes to land the idea are nicely timed. Some good old comedy to support a cause that&#x2019;s close to my heart. Cheers dudes, nicely done.&#x201d; For more information, visit ididthteditorial.com.
