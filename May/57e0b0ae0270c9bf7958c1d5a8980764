"We are delighted that Grant, who is undoubtedly one of SA's most respected and experienced retailers, has accepted the appointment as chief operating officer, transitioning to the CEO position in early 2018. He has been closely involved in various aspects of the group's strategic direction and working closely with Bernie on a day-to-day basis over the coming months will result in seamless continuity. "Bernie's leadership over the last two years has not only ensured the group's survival, but has positioned Edcon appropriately in rebuilding the business and ensuring long-term sustainability. We will always be grateful for his significant contribution and the guidance and knowledge he has passed-on to the Edcon team," Penny said. Source: BDpro
