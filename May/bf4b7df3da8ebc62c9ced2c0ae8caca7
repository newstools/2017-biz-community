Overall winners included the HTC Vive, which won the coveted Gadget of the Year award, and WeChat Wallet, which won Financial App of the Year. WeChat also took home the award for overall App of the Year. Computer of the Year &#x2014; always a hotly contested category &#x2014; went to the Dell XPS 13, unseating Apple, which has dominated the category in recent years with its MacBook Pro and Air devices. It took the award based on style, portability and performance in South Africa. The computer weighs less than 1.3 kilogrammes and is barely one centimetre thick when closed. Its InfinityEdge display squeezes a 13-inch display into an 11-inch frame, available in 1080p and QHD resolutions - that&#x2019;s up to 3200 pixels across.
