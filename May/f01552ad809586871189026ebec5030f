Jaco will strategically compliment iProspect&#x2019;s aggressive growth plans, with his expertise in digital as he takes on the lead responsibility of servicing the company&#x2019;s clients in the South African market.&#x201d; Dentsu Aegis Network culture of nurturing talent: Koo continues, &#x201c;Dentsu Aegis Network has a culture of nurturing and promoting high potential talent into management roles. Jaco is the youngest managing director to join the management team but is not the only senior manager under 30, as the company thrives on ensuring talent is groomed for leadership.&#x201d; Jaco stated, &#x2018;&#x2018;It is a great and exciting challenge for me to take on. Coming from within the DAN group assists me tremendously, I have an understanding of our clients&#x2019; business and current work streams and can step right in.&#x201d; The importance of digital media in consumer journeys Jaco mentions, &#x201c;If I look at my own life, the way we experience the world has rapidly changed in the past 10 years. How we communicate with friends, family and brands, is now more often than not digital in some shape or form. iProspect and the products we offer advertisers plays a critical role in Dentsu Aegis Network&#x2019;s unique operating model. We are future proofing ourselves in a few areas at the moment, gearing our business to combat the constant pace of change that will only increase. I truly believe that there is a massive opportunity for advertisers to be more sophisticated and smarter with every investment, there are so many tangible ways to track performance. The trick is to get the mixture between technology, data, creativity and the correct people right.&#x201d; Jaco will continue his role as Head of Amnet SSA, but will have additional responsibilities of driving all the performance based media channels, to make sure clients get media plans that incorporate all the consumer touchpoints.
