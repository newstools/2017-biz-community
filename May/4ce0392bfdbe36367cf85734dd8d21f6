 Peter Titmuss 123RF.com&#x201c;South African Airways has announced the appointment of Phumeza Nhantsi as SAA&#x2019;s new Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The appointment is effective from 1 May 2017,&#x201d; SAA said on Wednesday. The 39-year-old Nhantsi was appointed as SAA&#x2019;s Interim CFO in November 2015 after the position was left vacant following the departure of Wolf Meyer. The appointment followed a rigorous recruitment and selection process before a recommendation was made to the Shareholder for concurrence. &#x201c;Since the appointment of the full-strength Board in September 2016, the focus has been on stabilising the business and one of the priorities was to ensure that key management vacancies are filled. &#x201c;This is one such key appointment for the airline to ensure that SAA&#x2019;s strategic objective of transforming the business into a financially sustainable aviation group is achieved,&#x201d; said SAA Acting Chief Executive Officer Musa Zwane. Prior to joining SAA, Nhantsi was a Director at SizweNtsalubaGobodo, the fifth-largest accounting firm in Southern Africa and the largest black-owned and managed firm. She was temporarily seconded from SizweNtsalubaGobodo to SAA. Nhantsi, who is a chartered accountant, has extensive experience in the financial services and aviation arena. &#x201c;We congratulate Ms Nhantsi on her appointment and wish her well in executing her responsibilities,&#x201d; said Zwane.
