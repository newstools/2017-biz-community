 Brian Jackson 123RF.comGeneral Manager of CityVarsity Braamfontein, Zenzele Zungu said, &#x201c;The Gauteng Film Commission has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with CityVarsity with the aim of helping students who may be experiencing financial difficulty and cannot afford to study. This sponsorship is also extended to existing students who are unable to complete their studies due to financial constraints.&#x201d; This endeavour is changing the lives of people who would not normally get an education in the career path that they desire especially when it comes to receiving funding for a creative arts qualification. Studying a creative arts qualification can be challenging with the current job climate, but recipients of the funding from the Gauteng Film Commission will also be aided by knowledge and training. The Gauteng Film Commission has not only donated funding but has also generously decided to donate time, knowledge and expertise to the students. They will host workshops that educate students on how to apply for jobs, putting together a proposal and what to expect in a real life work environment. The Commission has even dedicated time to helping graduates find job placements within their chosen career path. For more information on CityVarsity, visit www.cityvarsity.co.za
