As with previous years, the 2017 edition of the awards sees an adjudication panel made up of people from various disciplines, including strategy, digital, creative, research, media and marketing as well as agency heads to judge the &#x2018;work that works&#x2019;. Judges will be looking for campaigns that disrupted the clutter, had extensive reach and communicated via mediums that resonate with the desired consumer. The adjudication process spans three rounds, during which submissions are judged against specific criteria including rigour, degree of difficulty, clarity of evidence, compelling case and insight. Judges "Apex affirms the credibility and the value of creativity in business activity. The awards, and more specifically, the results attained by the communications campaigns affirm our professions&#x2019; contribution to business success. They add and reinforce credence in the profession and affirm its contribution to the broader economy and business success," says Odette van der Haar, CEO of ACA. The 2017 Apex awards are hosted by the ACA with sponsors Kantar Millward Brown, Liberty Life and Unilever. For more information, click here.
