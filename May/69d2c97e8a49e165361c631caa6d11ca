According to the owner, Barend Smit, &#x201c;This is a big project since the entire property will be refurbished. In addition to a redesigned front fa ade, the work involves the renovation of all the rooms, and each will have a brand-new bathroom, new flooring, and fresh furnishings. &#x201c;While we have decided to refresh the property, we are conscious of the need to retain the features that give this hotel its charm, so the refurbishment takes this into account,&#x201d; Smit explains.

The plan is for the project to be carried out in phases, and certain sections of the property will be closed during particular phases of the work. &#x201c;We have no doubt that the hotel will be even more attractive to tourists and business travellers alike, and that we will continue to enhance the appeal of the region,&#x201d; concludes Smit.
