This sweeping section of natural beauty is also one of the finest roads for spirited driving - if there is no one else about. The only thing missing was the wind in my hair, but I just heard the good news: the Audi R8 Spyder V10 is now locally available to those with foreign passports. The R8 Spyder weighs in at only 1720kg, thanks to its ultra-light multimaterial Audi Space Frame, which has been constructed with a combination of aluminium and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP). The soft top itself is an anorexic 44 kilos, and is capable of opening and closing in 20 seconds, at speeds of up to 50km/h. Audi says the new R8 Spyder has become significantly better, with nearly 50% higher torsional rigidity, which is the winning recipe for razor-sharp handling and &#x201c;acoustically pleasing vibration behaviour&#x201d;. Expect your hair to be fully blown back With a ten-cylinder engine that responds to the smallest blip of the throttle, you can expect your hair to be fully blown back in only 3.6 seconds - that&#x2019;s how briskly the R8 Spyder reaches a 100km/h. When the car comes to a stop, the stop-start system turns the engine off, which does give one the satisfaction of hearing it start up again with a snarl - but don&#x2019;t expect some ridiculously low fuel usage figure - even though Audi says it&#x2019;s only 11.7 litres of petrol per 100km, I know better&#x2026; after all, the R8 Spyder is not the car to drive your gran to the doctor with, unless she&#x2019;s having a heart attack and you need to get her to the emergency ward. This is where the all-wheel drive quattro system comes in handy. Up to a hundred percent of the power can be transferred to the front or rear axle, so if you&#x2019;re taking that corner at the speed of light, the wheel-selective torque control applies minor braking to the inside wheels, keeping the R8 as stable and smooth as a prosperity preacher. The interior wows you with its perfect execution of minimalist luxury. The Audi virtual cockpit also displays a tachometer that shows power output and torque of the 397kW 5.2 FSI engine. There&#x2019;s also a lap timer and, my personal favourite, launch control. It automatically engages the clutch at 4500rpm and will then, abruptly, send you off to the moon. The price for all this pleasure? The Audi R8 Spyder V10 quattro S tronic will cost you R2,905,500. Go to www.audi.co.za for more.
