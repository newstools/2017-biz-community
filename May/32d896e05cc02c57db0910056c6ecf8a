&#x201c;With a first-time delivery success rate of over 99,99% to schools, we are encouraged that the partnership with the DBE allows us to help continue making a difference by providing learners with much-needed material for their academic journey. As education is the backbone of any society, we are indeed privileged to be part of such an important project,&#x201d; says Keith Vroon, CEO at Novus Holdings. All official languages The project will aim to provide learners with workbooks that cover literacy, numeracy and life skills in all eleven official languages. It will also assist teachers in creating a stimulating learning experience for learners, providing a platform for equal education across all schools in South Africa. The workbooks will be printed by Paarl Media, the printing division of Novus Holdings in partnership with Lebone Litho and distributed by DSV. Apart from the learners and teachers who have previously benefited from the workbook project, over 5,600 people had been employed with a further 2,600 new job opportunities created during the course of the first workbook project. &#x201c;The project has proved to be an efficient and structured platform that delivers. It is well-received by schools, as learners, teachers and principals are assured of on-time delivery. Together with Lebone and DSV, we are confident that our partnership with the DBE will be just as successful going forward,&#x201d; concludes Vroon.
