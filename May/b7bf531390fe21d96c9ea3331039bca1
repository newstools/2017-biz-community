The Premium Rusks include farm fresh buttermilk and are available in three variants - Buttermilk & Muesli, Buttermilk & Bran and Buttermilk & Aniseed. The Mini Bite Size Rusks are available in Buttermilk and Muesli flavours, packed in 200g boxes. &#x201c;We are excited to bring even more variety to our range as well as to leading stores across the country with our two new additions. Thanks to their great recipes, they will no doubt soon become firm favourites, offering South Africans new reasons to #DipnOUMA,&#x201d; says Lonwabo Thinta, brand manager for Ouma Rusks. The new Premium Rusks and Mini Bite Size Rusks are available nationwide, retailing at approximately R47.99 and R16.99 respectively.
