It was as if the judgement was based on public opinion, not on the law.&#x201d; &#x201c;I would rather have a process that is clean; that is clinical and that when it is scrutinised it can pass the test of scrutiny,&#x201d; she explains. In April, the Western Cape High Court ruled in favour of NGOs Earthlife Africa and the Southern African Faith Communities Environment Institute. The court found that agreements with the various countries were unlawful and unconstitutional. Public oversight and participation had been lacking.
