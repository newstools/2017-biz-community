Talk us through this year&#x2019;s wins for the agency. Native VML was awarded a Wood Pencil for our Twitter Refugees campaign.

We are delighted to add a D&AD Pencil to its list of accolades. Using Twitter bot to change 'refugee' to 'human being' creates 100 million impressionsNative VML wanted to create a healthy conversation on social media about the dehumanising connotations of the word 'refugee' and remind the world that these people are human beings with real fears, hopes and dreams...By Adrien Dawans 12 Sep 2016 What was your previous D&AD &#x2018;pencil box&#x2019; record? This is Native VML&#x2019;s first D&AD Pencil ever! D&AD has never really been on our list of priority shows because we focus primarily on the Loeries, Bookmarks and Cannes (award shows are expensive!) This year, we dipped our toes in the water with a couple of entries and we are super stoked with the results. Share your strategy to keep those international accolades coming. CEO and chief creative officer at Native VML, Jason Xenopoulos.Entering the big international award shows is a bit like buying a lottery ticket. There are so many thousands and even tens of thousands of great entries that it is incredibly difficult to win through. That said, our strategy is, and will always be, to do the best and most authentic work possible &#x2013; work that has a purpose, that inspires us, and that represents what we believe in as individuals and as an agency. Then we work tirelessly to package it in a world-class way. When you enter a show like Cannes Lions you have to know that in order to win your work has to be the best in the world. If you aren&#x2019;t prepared to craft it to the point where it is literally the best in the world, then don&#x2019;t bother entering. Sound advice. Here&#x2019;s hoping for much more of that great South African work to come. Click here for a reminder of all of South Africa&#x2019;s 2017 D&AD Pencil winners.
