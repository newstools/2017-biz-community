 Joanna Zaleska 123RF.comIn the video produced by AFP, the head of Ferray, Hidenobu Fukuda explains he introduced the "office cat" policy in order to reduce stress. Employees are encouraged to bring their cats to work, and Fukuda says that he will even give 5000 yen (just under R600) to those who want to adopt a rescue cat. When not chasing their toys, the cats can be seen wandering about and lolling on desks. As a cat lover, I've all but bought my ticket to Japan, although I do know that working with cats around isn't without its share of... mishaps. As Fukuda says, there are the occasional incidents of dropped calls as a cat steps on the phone, or computers being switched off as they walk over a power button. Obviously, this isn't going to be everyone's kind of scene, and one would have to consider several factors before introducing a pet policy to the office. As I said before, one would have to be a cat lover to tolerate this kind of situation, and then we have allergy sufferers who wouldn't be able to tolerate this at all (without a diet of antihistamines). One would possibly have to consider a cat-free zone for clients with potential issues as well. Ferray is not the first to implement pet policies in the workplace though. Here's a list of 15 companies in the USA that let their employees bring their dogs to work: Amazon Ben & Jerry's Big Spaceship Bissell Homecare Build-A-Bear Workshop Etsy Google Kimpton Petplan Procter & Gamble Replacements, Ltd.
