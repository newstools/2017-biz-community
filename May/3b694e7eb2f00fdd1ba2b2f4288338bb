Michael Ritchie, MD/Executive Producer: Revolver/Will O'Rourke LIA websiteRitchie began his career in agencies, head of broadcast at Ogilvy in Sydney, then a regional gig at DDB HK. From there, he moved to the production side and, in 1999, saw his most successful collaboration when he joined and later became partners with Steve Rogers at Revolver. Revolver/Will O&#x2019;Rourke, an Australian based production company. Ritchie stated, &#x201c;Being asked to be president of the LIA Production & Post-Production and Music Video jury is a privilege. I am at the point where I just do not want to justify why craft is essential in our industry. I think it is intrinsic to every single human in this world that they will respond to something made with care and craft far more than something that is not. It is that simple. I cannot wait to see the work that is entered and for the good stuff to rise to the top.&#x201d; &#x201c;We are honoured to have Ritchie preside over the jury. His dedication and belief that craft is something that can make a good idea great and a great idea, exceptional, makes him the perfect choice to guide this jury in awarding the most outstanding work at LIA 2017,&#x201d; stated Barbara Levy, president of LIA.

This year, in addition to the global &#x2018;Of the Year&#x2019; Awards, LIA will also award Regional &#x2018;Of the Year&#x2019; Awards, making it is even more important for production and post-production companies to enter their work and get the recognition they deserve.&#x201d;For more information, click here.
