Says Premlall: &#x201c;We saw 235 people die on our roads over the Easter weekend &#x2013; a 51% increase over last year&#x2019;s figure of 156 according to transport minister Joe Maswanganyi. Many of these accidents could have been avoided if vehicles had been serviced.&#x201d; Compulsory, periodic roadworthy testing Premlall believes compulsory roadworthy testing would go a long way to making a difference. &#x201c;An introduction of compulsory, periodic roadworthy testing is long overdue. Unassuming consumers need to be regularly educated on the condition of the car they drive. Commuters would also have the assurance that public transport vehicles were being tested regularly.&#x201d; Coupled with this, Premlall says it is crucial that credible roadworthy testers are used and stricter controls on the policing side thereof are implemented. Get into the habit &#x201c;However, in the absence of compulsory roadworthy testing, as responsible road users, we need to get into the habit of regularly servicing our vehicles.&#x201d; Cathy Yeulet via 123RF He points out that many workshops, including MIWA workshops, offer free vehicle checks at different times in the year, especially ahead of the holidays. &#x201c;If you are aware, you will repair. Sadly, many South Africans still choose not to take advantage of these offers and not only endanger themselves on our roads but also the drivers around them who may have done the right thing and had a service. More needs to be done to bring these senseless deaths to an end. More policing, stricter penalties for violations and more vehicle maintenance,&#x201d; he says. He recommends that vehicle owners keep a close eye on the manual and schedule maintenance accordingly. &#x201c;Keeping up with your vehicle's recommended maintenance schedule can help avoid costly problems with the cooling system, drivetrain, suspension and other components, for example.&#x201d; Choose reputable workshops He also encourages drivers to ensure their vehicle is serviced by a reputable workshop that only uses quality oil, fluids and parts. &#x201c;While it might sound like an attractive option to service your vehicle for as cheaply as possible, making sure you understand that the financial implications in the long run will outweigh the apparent short-term benefit.&#x201d; &#x201c;We all need to do what we can to ensure our roads become safer. Making sure your vehicle is roadworthy is a good first step,&#x201d; he concludes.
