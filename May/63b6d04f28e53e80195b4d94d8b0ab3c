Forbes Woman Africa, the continent&#x2019;s first-ever women&#x2019;s interest magazine from the highly-successful Forbes stable, launches its very first television show through Forbes Africa TV, in partnership with Ecobank. Against the Odds with Peace Hyde premiered on CNBC Africa last week, adding another thought-provoking and inspirational lifestyle show to their arsenal. The 12-part series celebrates the achievement of exceptional women in business. Award-winning presenter and journalist, Peace Hyde, joins editor of Forbes Woman Africa, Methil Renuka, in the premiere episode to discuss the vision behind the series. Commenting on the importance of having a strong platform like Forbes Woman Africa translated from a print to a television platform, Renuka noted that: &#x201c;Why only talk about the glass ceiling when you have ceiling-crashers who have done it all and can show the way. They may be very few, but they have had significant successes and a discerning show like this will be lessons from those who made it, to those who would like to scale those same heights and more, very much in line with Forbes Woman Africa&#x2019;s own rich content philosophy.&#x201d; &#x201c;The essence of the show is to really celebrate exceptional women. It&#x2019;s about women who have tapped into their courage and persistence, and chosen to keep going in spite of all the hurdles. I think that in order for you to do that you need to have a very strong understanding of your purpose...&#x201d; explained Hyde. Against the Odds with Peace Hyde premieres on CNBC Africa, Canal Plus Channel 171, DStv Channel 410 and StarTimes Channel 309 later this year.
