Jaguar specialist Clayton Classics, Aston Martin specialist Nicholas Mee, luxury car dealerships Romans and Stratstone, and classic car specialist Fiskens are just a few of the confirmed City Concours automotive partners. Luxury brands The top collection of cars on display isn&#x2019;t the event&#x2019;s only attraction, with a number of luxury brands showcasing their goods and a host of quality food and drink options. Auction house RM Sotheby&#x2019;s will be hosting a breakfast each morning of the City Concours and champagne house Taittinger will host its own champagne tent. Andrew Evans, City Concours Director, said: &#x201c;With such an amazing lineup of cars and luxury partners, we&#x2019;ve got a very special show in store. Whether it&#x2019;s stopping by for a glass of champagne and a wander round the cars or a breakfast in the stunning Honourable Artillery Company grounds, there will be plenty for visitors to see and do.&#x201d;
