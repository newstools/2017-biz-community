Parklife will once again host artists from a variety of genres across three different stages, including the Electronic Music Stage. International DJ&#x2019;s De Hofnar and Melvv join the Electronic Music line-up on The Arch stage and singer-songwriters Matt Simons and Gavin James will bring their incredible live performances to the two main stages &#x2013; Park Stage and Nux Stage. Matt Simon New York-based singer-songwriter Matt Simons achieved his greatest commercial success with Catch & Release, the title track from his self-titled album, Catch & Release. The single achieved far bigger success after it was remixed by Dutch house duo producers Deepend, charting as Catch & Release (Deepend Remix) in a number of European charts including Austria, France, Germany and peaking at No. 1 on Ultratop, the official Belgian Singles Chart. DJ De Hofnar De Hofnar won over local fans when he collaborated with GoodLuck on the hit single, Back In The Day, reaching #1 on radio charts across SA. His 2013 debut single, Oxas, in collaboration with Gamper & Dadoni, was released by MGM Records and his first record hit over 12m plays on Spotify. Shortly thereafter his first official EP, &#x2018;Zonnestraal&#x2019; was released and hit over 6m plays on Spotify and Soundcloud. With these tracks and the well-known remixes of Same Love (Macklemore), All of Me (John Legend) and Klanga (Gostan), which got 15m plays on Youtube and Soundcloud and got supported by Tiesto, Oliver Heldens and Sam Feldt, De Hofnar quickly made a name in the melodic deep house scene. Gavin James With over a quarter of a billion streams to his name, sold out shows from the US to Australia and over 15,000 people seeing him perform in his hometown of Dublin, Irish singer-songwriter Gavin James is fast becoming the breakthrough international artist for 2017.

Melvv kicked off last year&#x2019;s festival season with a performance at the legendary Coachella Music Festival, with a set at the Do Lab Stage. He later went on to tour with Big Gigantic, Louis The Child, and Jai Wolf. Between his hectic touring schedule, Melvv&#x2019;s most recent singles, Goodbye and Not Me have topped the Hype Machine charts and have millions of streams across the world. Melvv&#x2019;s unique musical background that includes early exposure to jazz, electronic, classical, and rock has come to influence him immensely.
