 LIA Awards Facebook pageOver the past few years, LIA has had many requests to add regional award competitions. After much discussion, LIA decided it would not be prudent to add new competitions that would compete with already established local and regional shows. Hence it has decided to break out our global winners and honour them by region. In speaking with industry professionals around the world, it was determined that winning a regional &#x2018;Of the Year&#x2019; award from a global festival would be a higher honour than winning a local/regional show. &#x201c;Companies enter awards to promote themselves to brands; the more awards you win, the more clients you attract. Winning a coveted &#x2018;Of the Year&#x2019; winged statue in your own region will give you the recognition you deserve in the eyes of not just your peers, but also current and potential clients,&#x201d; explained Barbara Levy, president of LIA.
