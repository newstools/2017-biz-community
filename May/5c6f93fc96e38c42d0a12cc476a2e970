"From inception, our business was very strong in offering clients print media solutions, specifically in the area of recruitment marketing (aka recruitment advertising). Some five years ago or so, we started noticing a shift in client requirements. There were more and more requests for solutions that spanned across various media platforms, all driven by well thought-out branding strategy. This led us to embark on a journey of our own evolution, directed by a continuous interrogation of our offering, a quest to deeply understand and anticipate our client needs, thereby allowing us to be able to develop the right kind of solutions for our clients. In a nutshell, I like to think of it as us developing business solutions, using strategy-led communications." You&#x2019;ve decided to diversify by offering two separate brands, being: Ayanda Mbanga (your personal brand) and AMcomms: The Can-Do Company. What is the thinking behind this? "The reason behind this is to attempt to separate Ayanda Mbanga (the personal brand) from AMcomms (the business brand). With a 19-year business track record, we believe the time is right. It is also to acknowledge the fact that there is a whole team of experts and professionals who bring their own kind of flavour to the offering, and not just Ayanda herself. Our tagline (The Can-Do Company) is meant to encapsulate exactly that which we do &#x2013; which is To Do. There is no business challenge, however big or small, which we feel cannot be solved. Our attitude, therefore, is that everything is solvable through communications." What is the meaning and philosophy behind "Can Do"? "We tackle every client's business challenge with a can-do attitude. Even if we cannot provide the solution ourselves, we will go and find partners who can &#x2013; all the time being cognisant of budget, timing and quality. We know what it's like to build and sustain a brand from scratch. We went through that ourselves as a business, with very little budget. We believe it is exactly that empathy and understanding that helps us to be able to fathom and interpret our clients' challenges, and to be able to solve them, regardless of the size of their budgets.
