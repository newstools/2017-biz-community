Female Founders of Coding Initiatives, taking place on 17 May 2017 at the V&A Waterfront will present three initiatives, elaborating on their work, struggles, and achievements. Code for Cape Town Code4CT exists to see young women empowered to leverage technology for social innovation so that there is greater diversity in the African tech industry. The program provides high school girls with an enabling environment to imagine and create new technology that is relevant to a South African context. codeX codeX aims to solve two of Africa&#x2019;s major challenges: youth unemployment and the programming skills gap. It finds, trains, and places entry-level software developers to fuel Africa&#x2019;s growing digital economy. The initiative builds relationships with industry partners and assists in placing coders into jobs. Girlhype GirlHype is a female-oriented coding academy formed in 2003 to teach girls coding as a means to encourage them to consider careers in STEM. It offers two types of courses: the first is a three-month-long &#x201c;Tech Career Blueprint,&#x201d; targeted at preparing women and girls for their career in tech and entrepreneurship. The blueprints are aimed at designing web based apps. The second is the "Impact Course" where you choose small group classes or a 10-day bootcamp for an introduction to coding.
