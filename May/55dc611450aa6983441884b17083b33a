&#x201c;We have decided to award our business to Red September following a three-way pitch process. We feel that Red September&#x2019;s creative concepts and integrated digital approach aligns with our vision for the brand," says Dane Venter from Soviet Denim. Quintin Benade, managing director at Red September added, &#x201c;We are extremely excited to have won the Soviet business. It is another feather in the Red September cap to win our first clothing account. We have launched the first phase of our new brand campaign, Get Out There, that will be rolling out through winter, and we are already working on a summer campaign that will launch later in the year."
