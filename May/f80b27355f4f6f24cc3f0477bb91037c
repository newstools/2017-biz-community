Joey Khuvutlu Robyn CampbellMark Tomlinson, co-founder and managing director of the Johannesburg business will be taking over as group managing director, with Joey Khuvutlu replacing him and Robyn Campbell, who has grown with the business for nine years, taking on the position of managing director in the Cape Town office. Commenting on the appointments, FCB Africa Group CEO and Chief Creative Officer Brett Morris said that Moffatt was leaving the group to fulfill a lifelong dream: to travel the world with his wife and three young children. He said Moffatt would be sorely missed but that the group is well poised to continue growing from strength to strength. &#x201c;When someone as talented as Dave leaves the business, it&#x2019;s obviously going to provide an opportunity for others to step up and we&#x2019;re incredibly excited about the next generation of leadership at Hellocomputer,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The agency has cemented its place as one of the continent&#x2019;s leading digital specialists and has helped establish FCB Africa as a leading integrated agency. This is, however, just the beginning for us. The new team has considerable experience combined with youthful drive and passion for innovation, and we have some audacious ambitions for the future,&#x201d; he said. Tomlinson said he was thrilled to be a part of the change happening in the industry, and looking forward to going from strength to strength with Khuvutlu and Campbell. &#x201c;At FCB and Hellocomputer we are passionate about diversity and transformation in the advertising and digital sector, and there are simply no two people better than Joey and Robyn to head up their respective offices. I'd also like to thank Dave for his incredible contribution to the business and personal partnership in creating one of South Africa's pre-eminent digital agencies." Aside from award recognition, Tomlinson has judged at the Loeries, the Cannes Lions and the coveted FWAs; served as a committee member of The Bookmark Awards; and has sat on the DMMA Digital Creative Circle Judging panel. His work has also been published in publications like the Taschen&#x2019;s Web Navigation. Reflecting on his move, Moffatt said, &#x201c;Hellocomputer, and more recently our inclusion into the FCB Group, has been the most extraordinary journey. I&#x2019;ve enjoyed the trust of many wonderful clients, and had the privilege of being surrounded by immensely talented colleagues. I&#x2019;m going to miss it terribly, but look forward to watching Hellocomputer&#x2019;s future successes from the sideline.&#x201d;
