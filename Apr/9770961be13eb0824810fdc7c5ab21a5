&#x201c;The logo has remained unchanged since 2005, although the site has undergone major changes. It has always been an innovator in the classifieds&#x2019; space, so it is high time that the image of the site matches the level of sophistication and development that has been rolled out behind the scenes,&#x201d; says Claire Cobbledick, head of core for Gumtree South Africa. The new logo is similar to that of Gumtree UK, but with a unique colour palette inspired by the South African landscape. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve kept our iconic eucalyptus tree motif but upgraded it to look digital and fresh, making the most of negative space to make the logo pop. Because our audience is mobile-driven, the imagery will have to translate well across a range of devices and browsers, and we think it does exactly that.&#x201d; New look, better results In addition to a new look, the site promises better results for buyers and sellers. A two-step posting process will assist customers in getting their goods online much faster, while mandatory registration and image uploads (introduced earlier this month) will improve the quality of listings found on the site. &#x201c;We are combining years of experience and lessons learnt with best-of-breed technology to help South Africans achieve their goals faster, whether it is marketing their business, decluttering their homes or browsing for the best deals,&#x201d; says Johan Nel, director GM of Gumtree South Africa. &#x201c;Sellers can expect up to 10% more replies than before, according to testing in other markets. While the site looks different, it does exactly what it has always done, help South Africans to make quick cash or find a bargain.&#x201d; A 24/7 customer service team will be available to assist customers with navigating the site or answering concerns.
