The new format, called Amazon Go, was due to launch publicly at the end of March after being launched in beta mode to Amazon employees in Seattle in December 2016. In another of the company's attempts to modernise brick-and-mortar retail, Amazon Go cuts out the checkout process altogether by using sensors to track shoppers&#x2019; items. As Business Insider reports, the technology uses cameras, sensors, and algorithms to track what customers pick up for purchase. However, it's been reported the system malfunctions when more than 20 people are in the store. There have also been challenges trying to track an item if it has been "moved from its specific spot on the shelf". For now, the technology functions flawlessly only if there are a small number of customers present. Amazon is unable to confirm a launch date for the futuristic new grocery store at this stage.
