We are thrilled to add another international company to our family of clients and look forward to applying ourselves to coming up with new creative ways to convey Krispy Kreme&#x2019;s brand to the South African public. Decimal Agency&#x2019;s Managing Director, Raffaele Mc Creadie, commented: &#x201c;Global brands entering the South African market always catch the keen eye of advertising agencies &#x2013; just look at Starbucks, Burger King, and Uber to name a few. There is, however, only one Krispy Kreme and I&#x2019;m super proud of my team for landing the account; fittingly Krispy Kreme is sweet and so is the victory in winning their business. More so I&#x2019;m excited to become a strategic partner to Krispy Kreme and adding value. It&#x2019;s vital we create a long-term partnership as they aggressively open new stores.&#x201d; Krispy Kreme launched in South Africa in late 2015 with a hugely successful store located at the Zone @ Rosebank. Since then these delicious doughnuts have been in high demand, with consumers queueing up outside their stores daily. Currently there are eight Krispy Kreme stores located in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, with plans to open another 23 stores and the possibility of expansion into Africa. Krispy Kreme South Africa Marketing Manager Erin Kriel weighed in: &#x201c;We believe in empowering local businesses who understand South Africa and its people. We are excited at the creative strategy Decimal Agency is capable of and look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship for not only Krispy Kreme SA and Decimal Agency, but our existing and potential guests across our beautiful nation - get ready to #ShareTheJoy.&#x201d; Our team is extremely excited to partner with such a well-known global brand that has a clear plan of expanding across the country. We&#x2019;re planning on helping the brand take flight through innovative and engaging campaigns. Gaining the Krispy Kreme account is our first major win for 2017 and we&#x2019;re excited to take our agency from good to great.
