To qualify, all you have to do is test drive either the Jaguar XE or Jaguar F-Pace at the new Jaguar Land Rover dealership in Tokai, Cape Town. The Jaguar Simola Hillclimb takes place from 4-7 May 2017 in Knysna. The SMG group was appointed to represent Jaguar Land Rover in Cape Town after its successes in Kwa-Zulu Natal. The showroom areas have clearly defined space for the latest models, approved used cars as well as a service and parts centre. Headed up by dealer principal Andrew Potgieter, the professional sales executive team comments: &#x201c;Our branch makes purchasing and servicing more convenient for our customers in the Southern Suburbs and also significantly boosts our visibility in the area, with our cutting-edge designed vehicle showroom.&#x201d; The premium customer experience at purchase includes a two-stage car handover, where the vehicle along with a gift and photographs of the moment are given to the new owner. The owner returns the following day for a technology training session with the SMG product genius to ensure that they get maximum value and knowledge of their newly acquired vehicle.
