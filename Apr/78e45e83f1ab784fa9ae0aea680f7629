In a record-breaking year, 8,506 more votes were received than in previous year. The 13 categories ranged from wine estates that provide unforgettable food to wine-tastings with a twist, game-viewing, or simply naturistic views of vineyards, and a 14th award for the finalist that received the most overall votes from consumers &#x2013; the SupaNova award. The Klink Awards is the South African wine tourism industry&#x2019;s only consumer-driven competition (determining the winners), with a one vote per person, per category rule. An exciting new category introduced this year was &#x201c;Touring&#x201d; - big and small touring companies were called upon in order to uncover the brightest gems of destinations, experiences, wine and food that are distinctively wine tourism. Says Monika Elias, founder of the Klink Awards: &#x201c;Our wine farms are without a doubt and unquestionably at a world-class standard, so it&#x2019;s a great honour that we can acknowledge the outstanding contribution that they&#x2019;re making to attract tourists from all over the world to South Africa, and provide them with the unique experience that each one offers. The winners should feel incredibly proud as they certainly competed against some very stiff competition. A heartfelt congratulations to all the winners from us at Wine Tourism South Africa.&#x201d; The 2017 Klink Awards winners are: Best Winelands Burger: A burger is not just a burger; it is a staple on any menu worth its salt.
