They will be followed by a range of bikes from 600cc to 1000cc as the Breakfast Runs gets underway promising 10 laps of skilled racing action. A crowd favourite &#x2013; the 150 Honda and Scooters &#x2013; will then go head-to-head followed by the not-to-be-missed Legends car race. Originating in the 1930s and 1940s, the Legends vehicle is a compact car shell fitted with a 1300cc motorbike engine, and these zooty cars always make for a fantastic spectator sport.
