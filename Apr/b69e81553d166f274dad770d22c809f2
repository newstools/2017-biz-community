From 1 May, the new range of amenity kits (eight types for men and eight for women) will be offered to business class customers on international flights, with two designs launching every few months. Collectible pieces of uniquely Australian stories Qantas Group Executive Brand, Marketing and Corporate Affairs, Olivia Wirth said the airline&#x2019;s vision is to grow awareness of contemporary Australian art and give travellers a collectible piece to take with them. &#x201c;As the national carrier, we&#x2019;re pleased to support talented Aussies telling uniquely Australian stories through their artwork and share them with a global audience,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Along with in-flight pajamas, we know amenity kits are an important part of the international business class experience. Customers love the functionality of our kits and many use them after their flight as make-up bags, an evening clutch or to carry their mobile phones. So, the exposure is broad.&#x201d; Billie Justice Thomson, whose artwork Fairy Bread will feature on an amenity kit for women said she was proud to be part of a programme that showcases artwork in such a unique way. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really exciting to be part of an art exhibition at 38,000 feet. This is a powerful way to share contemporary art, particularly alongside some of Australia&#x2019;s most talented artists,&#x201d; she said. The amenity kits include ASPAR products by Aurora Spa (hand cream, lip balm and face moisturiser), a wrap-around eye mask in the same artwork as the kit, Colgate toothpaste, toothbrush, earplugs and travel socks. A long history with the arts Qantas has a long history of providing opportunities for Australian artists to connect with global audiences. Most recently Qantas joined Sydney&#x2019;s Museum of Contemporary Art and Tate in the UK in an International Joint Acquisition Programme for contemporary Australian art made possible through a corporate gift from the Qantas Foundation. Qantas also has an Indigenous art aircraft series and is a long-time supporter of various arts organisations including the National Gallery of Australia, Opera Australia, Australian Ballet and Bangarra Dance Theatre.
