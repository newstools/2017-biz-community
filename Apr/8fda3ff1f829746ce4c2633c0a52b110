Friday: Evening &#x2013; Make your escape British Airways&#x2019; Friday schedule gets you out of Johannesburg (take the 7pm or 8pm flight) or Durban (6pm) with time to settle in on the other side. It&#x2019;s an easy 15-minute drive from the airport in a hire car to the city, where the Belmond Mount Nelson &#x2013; or &#x2018;The Nellie&#x2019; as locals affectionately call it &#x2013; awaits your arrival. #Repost @voguemagazine &#x30fb;&#x30fb;&#x30fb; The bubblegum pink Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel is the preferred place to bunk on one of the most popular routes in Africa on the Rovos Rail. Take a journey on the family-owned sleeper train in the link in our bio. Photographed by @jo_rodgers.

Afterwards, head out to gentrifying Salt River and order the brilliant craft beer and food pairing board at Devils Peak Taproom. Saturday: 09:00 &#x2013; Get a caffeine hit Head to the Woodstock Exchange at 66 Albert Road on the fringe of the CBD and kickstart your day with the java enthusiast&#x2019;s choice: an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe at Rosetta Coffee. Browse boutiques and galleries for a taste of cutting-edge design, marvel at Pedersen + Lennard&#x2019;s furniture solutions, or simply fall in love with artisanal leatherwear at Urban Africa&#x2019;s Atlier. Hands down the best coffee in #CapeTown is at @rosettaroastery No doubt about it. It's located at the #WoodstockExchange - one of my favourite places in the city! #proteatakeover #weekendtakeover A post shared by Protea Hotels by Marriott (@proteahotels) on Mar 25, 2017 at 12:05am PDT 11:00 &#x2013; Hike the &#x2018;Pipe&#x2019; Put on your walking shoes and answer the call of Table Mountain. The Pipe Track on the Camps Bay side offers awesome views of the Twelve Apostles mountain range and is relatively flat, so you&#x2019;ll save some heartbeats for the rest of the day.

Clifton&#x2019;s fourth Beach is the classic (locals &#x2018;own&#x2019; first), but seasoned lotion-lovers will want to head for the more intimate Glen Beach off Camps Bay that&#x2019;s also a great surf and sundowner spot. Come catch the perfect wave! #WowSouthAfrica Glen Beach lies to the north of Camps Bay Beach in Cape Town, with two beaches divided by a rock formation. This area is famous for its beach-break surfing, which local surfers frequent! Along the shore, find small clusters of bungalows that enjoy direct access to the beach - perfect for the less-adventurous beach-goers!

Then it&#x2019;s time to browse rare and beautiful books at the excellent and well-stocked Book Lounge. 15:30 &#x2013; Back to nature Amble home via the historic Company&#x2019;s Garden, buy some nuts and hang out with the world&#x2019;s friendliest squirrels; or visit the SA National Gallery that closes at 5pm. But don&#x2019;t forget to leave time for the famous high tea offering back at the Mount Nelson Hotel.

You can&#x2019;t book at the latter, but there&#x2019;s a cool &#x2018;waiting bar&#x2019; downstairs where you can order a pre-dinner snack from the daily changing &#x2018;tapas for two&#x2019; menu. Your next stop should be Publik wine bar, home to Frankie Fenner Meats and the charcoal-fuelled Ash restaurant. See what interesting discoveries wine merchant David Cope has on offer by the glass, and buy some biltong for the next day.

It&#x2019;s a fitting stage for ridiculously fine fare, such as six-week old rib-eye on the bone, seared on a Rooikrans-fired grill.

Order the best Old Fashioned in town before following the beautiful people to the tiny bar behind the Honest Chocolate Shop on 64 Wales Street &#x2013; or go back up Bree to Mother&#x2019;s Ruin, just to prove the city&#x2019;s credentials as a global gin capital.

Head out in your hired car or find your way to a CBD stop of the topless, hop-on-hop-off City Sightseeing buses and let someone else do the driving while you enjoy the view &#x2013; and what a view it is. The round trip mini-peninsula route takes around two-and-a-half hours and buses are 25 minutes apart. As if you needed another reason to hop off the bus at @winchestermansions! #repost #foodie #atlanticseaboard #lovecapetown #redbussa #capetown A post shared by @citysightseeingsa on Feb 14, 2017 at 6:58am PST 10:00 - Do gardening duty Your first stop (20 minutes away) is Kirstenbosch Gardens. Breathe deep, wander free and feel the grandeur of Table Mountain. Don&#x2019;t miss the Boomslang canopy walkway before joining regulars for a moment of quiet contemplation in the uppermost corner where the Proteas grow. Here's a pic of the Boomslang @tyndall_craig #Boomslang #kirstenbosch #capetown A post shared by Martin Bolton (@boltonmartin) on Apr 15, 2017 at 11:57am PDT 12:00 &#x2013; Swirl, sniff and savour The next stop is Constantia Nek. Change to the purple wine route bus and get off at Groot Constantia. Then walk 10m down the road to Beau Constantia where the Cecily Viognier and Pierre Sauvignon-Semillon will blow you away almost as much as the view. When you&#x2019;ve had your fill, find bus seats on the upper left side and don&#x2019;t get off again until you reach the Sea Point stop at Winchester Mansions: the trip along the coast will show you why Capetonians hate leaving home. Last few days of holiday calls for settings like these, @beauconstantia you pretty thing! &#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd; #capetown #winetasting #beauconstantia A post shared by Famke (@famkek) on Jan 5, 2017 at 6:05am PST 14:30 &#x2013; Walk this way A stroll on Greenpoint Promenade towards the Waterfront with Table Bay at your side is so quintessentially Capetonian you&#x2019;ll feel like an extra in a movie. If walking isn&#x2019;t your thing and you feel the need to expand your horizons, why not try (safely) jumping off a mountain? Fly Cape Town will strap you into a tandem paraglider and help you make an unforgettable leap of faith off Signal Hill that could last anywhere from ten to 30 minutes. What a vibe! &#xfffd;&#xfffd; Thanks @shotleft! A post shared by Ruth Cooper (@remcoopkins) on Mar 30, 2017 at 7:37am PDT 15:30 &#x2013; Retail therapy Your breakaway ends at the V&A Waterfront &#x2013; still South Africa&#x2019;s biggest visitor attraction by miles. Avoid the madness of the centre and start with a 100% Angus beef classic cheeseburger from the short-order Mondial hatch. Then walk to the new Watershed market, home to over 150 designer stores such as Tiffany Marx&#x2019;s Inspired Jewellery and Odeon&#x2019;s home-grown homeware. After that, the Waterfront&#x2019;s your oyster until it&#x2019;s time to head out on the highway: you&#x2019;ll need 25 minutes to get to Cape Town International. Beauty all around. Happy Friday!
