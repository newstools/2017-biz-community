To be able to lead a team of researchers from various research institutions in South Africa is humbling,&#x201d; said Mphambukeli upon receiving the grant. She will spearhead a research project between BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) universities. &#x201c;They have awarded me a three-month grant to facilitate a process of combining various research projects under the BRICS Academic Cluster,&#x201d; Mphambukeli said. &#x201c;The academic cluster provides a platform for researchers and academics to engage in ongoing collaboration,&#x201d; she said. The grant will enable her and her research partner, Dr Victor Okorie, postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the UFS, to put together a research proposal to be submitted at the end of May 2017. If successful, her team will conduct a research study across BRICS countries over a period of three years. It will be done in collaboration with various South African universities, who will form a team to collaborate with researchers from BRICS universities. &#x201c;The funds we have received are quite a great accomplishment for the UFS and our department,&#x201d; Dr Okorie said. The UFS has become a force to be reckoned with when it comes to emerging issues in BRICS politics and policies. &#x201c;Our project looks at the provision of ecosystems, agriculture, and security and the UFS was chosen as the host institution.&#x201d;
