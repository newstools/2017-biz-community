T-Bose Mokwele and John Perlman celebrate 10 years with the station in 2017 and Georgie Munetsi Bizzah and Nicky B are celebrating 20 years with Kaya this year, having started in the year of Kaya's inception. While much success, tears and laughter have been shared, now is the time to make some line-up changes in-line with the vision to take the station into the future. Kaya started implementing future plans by making shifts with the last line-up change that revolved around evening and weekend radio in late 2016. Bridget Masinga and Kojo Baffoe joined in September and October of 2016 launching Late Nights with Bridget Masinga and Life with Kojo Baffoe. Tebogo &#x201c;Proverb&#x201d; Thekisho was brought on to take over the Top 40 on a Saturday morning and Thomas Msengana coming in on Fridays and Saturdays with Weekends with Thomas. Other empirical changes involved T-Bose taking over Sunday afternoons with Sunday Soul Sessions. &#x201c;The changing landscape of the afropolitan in the South African context is going to be challenging in many ways and will require deep meaningful conversations which Kaya aims to deliver with the announcement of the new line-up," says Kaya FM Managing Director Greg Maloka. Kaya will make the announcement of the new line-up on Thursday, 13 April 2017.
