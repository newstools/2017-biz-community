Group CEO, Tewolde GebreMariam, says: &#x201c;With the largest and most modern dedicated freighter fleet and the largest cargo network connecting African countries with their major trading partners around the world, Ethiopian Cargo is contributing its own share in the fast and sustainable economic development of Africa. &#x201c;Airfreight plays a critical role in international trade and especially in the carriage of high value goods, temperature-controlled cargo like flowers, fruits and vegetables, pharmaceuticals, life sciences and so forth. &#x201c;This move will further strengthen trade and commercial ties between Africa and Europe. I wish to thank all who made these new routes possible.&#x201d; Currently, Ethiopian is providing the European market with minimum weekly tonnage capacity of 2,200 from Liege (LGG), deploying modern game-changing fleet, Boeing 777 freighter.
