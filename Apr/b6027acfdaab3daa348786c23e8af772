Growthpoint 151 on 5thPaul Kollenberg, Growthpoint Properties office regional asset manager, comments, &#x201c;The upgrade of this office park has done much to create and enhance the office environment that has taken shape in Sandton Central. It offers workspaces that foster collaboration and innovation, designed to appeal to businesses such as Primedia Unlimited.&#x201d; &#x201c;We are thrilled with our new home and it was wonderful working with the Growthpoint team who pulled out all the stops to make it a reality,&#x201d; said Primedia Unlimited CEO, Ryan Williams. Primedia Unlimited&#x2019;s new base of operations spans the park&#x2019;s entire Block C. It joins Wireless Data Services, which occupies Block A of the office park. Block B of 151 on 5th is available to occupy. Visual contact with nature The buildings&#x2019; new fa ades encapsulate offices offering visual contact with nature. The office blocks are interlinked with new landscaping, walkways, pause areas and external lighting. Each building was also refreshed internally and features modern new lobbies, bathrooms and kitchens. The buildings enjoys access to all main Sandton arterials including Sandton Drive, William Nicol Drive, Rivonia Road as well as Grayston Drive and the Grayston N1 off-ramp. In addition, the offices are only a short walk from many of the amenities at the heart of Sandton Central. This includes Sandton Convention Centre, Sandton City shopping centre, various hotels, the Virgin Active Classic gym on Alice Lane and the Sandton Gautrain Station as well as the many transport choices to which it links. Kollenberg concludes, &#x201c;Seeing the benefit and value of refurbishment and renovation, the office park has distinguished itself from its neighbouring high-rise structures. We believe that this low-rise park-like development offers a unique, people-friendly design solution to the Sandton Central office offering.&#x201d;
