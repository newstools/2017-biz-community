Following the successful inaugural Cape Town Flower Show held at The Castle of Good Hope in October 2016, event organisers, Growth Events believes that a very strong foundation has been built for the show. Karey Evett, CEO said: &#x201c;The show was well attended by the public and is positioned to become one of Cape Town&#x2019;s jewel events in the city&#x2019;s annual events calendar.&#x201d; The decision to move the show from The Castle of Good Hope was made due to the latter recently being declared a National Heritage site, which is a very important milestone for the conservation of this historic landmark. An event like the Flower Show, where the construction of the show gardens have a significant impact on the natural fabric of the site, was deemed not to be an ideal fit for the 350-year old building. Breath of fresh air Calvyn Gilfellan, CEO of the Castle Control Board, said: &#x201c;As an avid gardener myself, I am sad to see this iconic garden exhibition move to another venue. The show was a breath of fresh air during a year in which we dealt with the commemoration of the Castle&#x2019;s 350th year of existence. The 2016 version of the Cape Town Flower Show really transformed the image of the Castle into one of accessibility, attractiveness and education.&#x201d; Apart from the spectacle of the show gardens, the floral theatre and all the major attractions at the Cape Town Flower Show, the event in 2017 will have an even bigger focus on products and services that can help create awareness around water consumption, food security and conservation and give show visitors vital information about how to enjoy outdoor spaces and gardens, while being water-wise. Early bird tickets for The Cape Town Flower Show will be on sale through Webtickets until 31 July 2017. For more info, go to www.capetownflowershow.co.za.
