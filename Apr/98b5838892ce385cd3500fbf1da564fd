Access to contraception doesn&#x2019;t seem to be the problem. Using it correctly is still a problem in Brazil,&#x201d; Castro said at a seminar held March 23, 2017 at Harvard&#x2019;s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, The Harvard Crimson reported. She said that due to a high rate of contraceptive misuse, 40% of Brazilian pregnancies are unwanted. Access to safe, legal abortion in Brazil is severely restricted. While Zika transmission rates have fallen, Castro predicted that the virus is likely to come back. She recommended reducing standing water areas where mosquitoes breed as a strategy for reducing Zika incidence.
