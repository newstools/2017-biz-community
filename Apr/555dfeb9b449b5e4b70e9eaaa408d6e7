Koenderman was inducted into the Loeries Hall of Fame in 2015. He loved the advertising and marketing industry and played a role in it for over thirty years, having founded AdFocus and AdReview, with a weekly column at Financial Mail and FinWeek over the years. As a perfectionist, Koenderman pushed himself to compete against himself and while he loved journalism, his greatest pleasure was the friends he made in the industry, the people he met, particularly advertising&#x2019;s more rebellious creatives, and the conversations he had with the likes of Graham Warsop, Andy Rice, Ken Varejes and other advertising heavy weights. Many have shared their sadness on social media: Farewell #TonyKoenderman. A passionate ad man and a true wordsmith. You pioneered advertising journalism, and deserve the industry's salute&#x2014; Andy Rice (@ricecommaandy) April 10, 2017Pendoring is saddened by die passing of respected industry stalwart, Tony Koenderman.
