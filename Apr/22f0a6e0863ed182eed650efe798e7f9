Image Times Media. The awards ceremony was held at the Sandton Convention Centre, in the heart of Liberty country, the &#x201c;rich mile in Africa&#x201d;. The radio industry proved the saying &#x201c;having a face for radio&#x201d; wrong, as the who&#x2019;s who in the industry gathered in tuxedos and evening gowns to recognise the best in radio today. These were Kaya FM&#x2019;s and Umhlobo Wenene&#x2019;s second awards in this category respectively, with Kaya FM winning it in 2013 and Umhlobo Wenene in 2014. Umhlobo Wenene staff thanked their listeners for all their support. Great content, good advertising opportunities &#x201c;The award was unexpected and a surprise, although we felt in our hearts that we had a good chance because we have worked hard to create some exciting programmes and to really understand what our audiences want from us: to provide them with great content that talks about the things they want, while also creating good opportunities for advertisers,&#x201d; says Greg Maloka, MD of Kaya FM. MD and founder of Hot 91.9 FM, Lloyd Madurai, says their success is because of a passion for radio and a love for what they do. &#x201c;We are a bunch of people having fun because we love what we do and we will continue to do that, remaining humble and growing from strength to strength, and give back to the community we serve, through our radio academy and other means.&#x201d; Hot 91.9FM turns up the heat on Joburg's community radio offeringThe saddest moment of my youth?
