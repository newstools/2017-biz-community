Business leaders commit their support to new industry body Commenting on the importance of establishing such a representative industry body, says executive director of Packaging SA, Charles Muller: &ldquo;We welcome the formation of MetPac-SA as it is essential that the metal packaging sector is properly prepared and organised to play an integral part in submitting the Paper and Packaging Industry Waste Management Plan.&rdquo; Dr Casper Durandt, franchise technical manager for Coca-Cola Southern Africa, says &ldquo;Creating a body such at MetPac-SA will benefit the industry through a focused and aligned approach for packaging producers, including brand owners, to fulfil our extended producer responsibilities in cleaning up our environment, lowering our carbon footprint and saving our planet by collecting beverage cans for recycling. Through the joint efforts of other PRO&rsquo;s, such as PETCO and The Glass Recycling Company, MetPac-SA will allow us to make the most of synergistic opportunities that exist in non-returnable beverage container collection by diverting packaging away from landfill sites and creating dignified job opportunities for our people.&rdquo; This sentiment is echoed by Klaus Hass of Nampak Bevcan who says: &ldquo;The formation of MetPac-SA will provide the rigid metal industry of South Africa with a unified voice by bringing together all the relevant stakeholders (i.e. metal suppliers, packaging converters, brand owners, retailers and other national associations) to address the environmental aspect of packaging waste. We will be supporting the efforts of MetPac-SA because it will benefit the industry through creating a coordinated effort aimed at meeting the legal requirements for waste management and contributing to the national policies for an effective and sustainable outcome in a green, circular economy.&rdquo; &ldquo;MetPac-SA is excited to promote the versatility of metals through an ongoing marketing campaign, increase the market share of the industry and protect the interests of its members through stakeholder involvement. For this reason, we are encouraging more sector stakeholders to become members to ensure that the local metal packaging industry has a strong voice when matters that directly impact its present and future business interests are raised,&rdquo; Delanie concluded.
