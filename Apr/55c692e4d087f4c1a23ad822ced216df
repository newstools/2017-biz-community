This includes &#x2018;Ghost Box&#x2019;, a special programme that scans radio frequencies and interference, which are then translated into words that pop up onto one&#x2019;s cellphone screen, making it possible to talk to spirits just as a medium would. Over the past few weeks, &#x2018;Mystery Ghost Bus Tours of South Africa&#x2019; has been encouraging its guests to download these free apps and use them on the tours, where some of the electronic voice phenomena (EVP) recordings have been so clear that it will be using them with various other CD tracks that it plays on the ghost bus. In advertising for up-coming April tours, patrons have been encourages to download these ghost-detecting apps and try them out on the tours. The tours will run on 7 April in Johannesburg, 8 April in Irene and, given the tours&#x2019; recent sell-out successes of its &#x2018;Full Moon&#x2019; tours in Joburg and Irene, Cape Town will now have its first and last &#x2018;Full Moon&#x2019; tour on 11 April. Owner Mark Rose-Christie is thinking of retiring at the end of this year, after playing to over 30,000 people over 17 years, countrywide, including in Durban and Port Elizabeth.
