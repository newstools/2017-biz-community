Enabled by Sportal, the one-stop solution is seamless from click to delivery. &#x201c;Online retail is about selling an experience to the consumer and we have created a world class web journey for Orlando Pirates and their customers,&#x201d; says Sportal&#x2019;s co-founder, Jon Adams. &#x201c;For sports brands, Sportal is the quickest and easiest way to jump on to the digital stage, reach your support base and boost your income.&#x201d; The brains behind Sportal are Jon Adams (former Absa Cape Epic and Accenture London), e-commerce expert, Simon Leps (Fontera) and sports marketing and sponsorship adept, Chris Heaton (Brand inc). &#x201c;Working extensively within the industry, we saw how sports properties were increasingly pressurised to drive commercial value but were failing to capitalise on their assets and effectively monetise their loyal support base,&#x201d; continues Adams. Sportal addresses all these problems with digital shop solutions and fully designed, developed and hosted platforms. The company also provides strategic consulting services on rights management for sports properties and sponsors. After an assessment, a robust and custom-built digital system is deployed to manage rights effectively, and drive continual revenue growth through reporting and repackaging of those rights. &#x201c;SA sports sponsorship is often plagued with high costs, poor rights delivery and a lack of tangible ROI,&#x201d; says Adams. &#x201c;Effectively managing sponsors and applying industry best practice is key to retaining sponsorship. Rights holders need to be very pro-active in managing rights and controlling costs. &#x201c;We know rights holders&#x2019; pain points and can ensure that they get the best value for their assets and manage their property&#x2019;s rights well. For sponsors, it guarantees that your rights are delivered,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Sportal will disrupt the industry as it stands today,&#x201d; concludes Adams. &#x201c;We offer turnkey, cutting-edge digital and consulting solutions that drive business on multiple fronts and enable sports brands to grow and focus on what they do best, playing sport.&#x201d; To find out more go to www.sportalonline.com
