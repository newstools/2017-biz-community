"The company will record a profit before taxation of between R33.7m and R41.2m, an increase of between 157% and 214% on the R13.1m for the comparative period." The retailer said a major focus on reduction and containment of costs had helped to produce favourable results. It said this was achieved through a renewed cost benefit analysis and elimination of wasteful expenditure. The continuing improvement had resulted in cost increase being contained to below inflationary levels, said Verimark. Source: BDpro
