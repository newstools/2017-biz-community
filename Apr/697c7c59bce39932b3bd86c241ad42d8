From above, way up high in a tandem paraglide on an ideal still and sunny day I fell all that more in love with my city. Whoosh, after a shuffled run and leap off from Signal Hill, go-pro in hand, the hill soon disappeared and the city bowl and Atlantic seaboard opened up beneath my dangling feet. Best way to see #CapeTown city & coastline! Still glowing after yesterday's @ctparaglide! #ShotLeft #CTIJF2017 @ShotLeft #paragliding pic.twitter.com/jepKEDJjDr&#x2014; BizLounge (@Biz_Lounge) March 31, 2017 You see me gliding&#x2026; Soaring further out, the glittering Atlantic and harbour now took view preference. A glance to the left shows Lion's Head and the top of Table Mountain. Now we take a few stomach flipping turns over the ocean before swooping back towards solid ground. Gently alighting upon the grass patch that runs the length of the Sea Point promenade, I shakily unclip and step out of my harness. What a rush! The entire flight really flashes by in an instant, like I was literally in the air for about 6 minutes. (It can be longer depending on the wind conditions.) However, it is so serene, nothing but the sound of the air rushing by or the sound of your own whoops of delight (if prone to that). I would highly recommend a tandem flight for tourists and locals alike looking for a unique view of the city. I experienced my tandem paraglide with Cape Town Tandem Paragliding courtesy of Shot&#x2019;left in the run up to the Cape Town International Jazz Festival which just took place this past weekend.
