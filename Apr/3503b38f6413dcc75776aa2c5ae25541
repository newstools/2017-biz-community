It celebrates the successes of women throughout the built environment value chain and recognises organisations that support and contribute to their development in the industry. Athi Myoli, director of the Women in Construction Awards, says: &#x201c;The Women in Construction Awards are crucial for highlighting the strides women are making in the industry and the organisations supportive of their endeavours as this encourages more women to follow in their footsteps and other organisations to contribute to their success.&#x201d; Importance of peer recognition Expanding on the importance of this industry initiative, Noluthando Molao, associate director of Turner and Townsend, past winner of the Pioneer of Innovation Award category in 2016 highlights the importance of peer recognition for women in the industry, "Winning the award is recognition of all the hard work I've put in over the last ten years while building my career. I'd like to encourage other women wanting to break into the construction industry by saying that anything is possible with hard work, perseverance and a plan. It's vital to remember no-one wins alone. I have learnt that different people have different strengths and one should be able to acknowledge this and draw from this."
