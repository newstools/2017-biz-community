The bus strike, which was initiated on Wednesday, 12 April 2017, left hundreds of bus commuters without transport over the Easter holidays. Numsa general secretary, Irvin Jim said in a statement: We want to inform employers that it will take time for all our members to return to work. We expect that by Tuesday all our members should be back at work. We also want to remind the employer that we will not tolerate any victimisation of our members for their participation in the strike. Numsa will continue to pressurise the Department of Labour to do proper oversight in the bus passenger sector. The fact that our members, even under the new wage agreement will continue to be exposed to dangerously long hours without compensation is shameful. We are inspired by our members who demonstrated great courage and determination during the course of the strike. They were also extremely disciplined. We salute you for fighting for a dignified life for yourself and your families. We call on all workers in the sector to unite behind Numsa as we fight to transform the industry and restore dignity and equality to our members.
