Steph is currently freelancing at some of the country&#x2019;s best agencies and is always in pursuit her first love; that is film. "I watched all the work a couple of times and then proceeded to rearrange the bookshelf, call a friend, instagram the cat and have a nap. This time there was method to my procrastination. I wanted to see which piece of work stayed with me after I watched it." Her answer was Kyle Lewis&#x2019; Bad Hair for Nasty C. Here's why... "It&#x2019;s an audacious project. I can&#x2019;t imagine putting together a 14-minute music video. But the music, images and textures all come together to create a richly layered, visceral film in three parts or chapters. Each chapter has its own treatment and track (essentially its own music video), but it&#x2019;s held together seamlessly by some very clever editing, sound design and a strong aesthetic. "The opening sequence, images of bone in gold liquid expertly edited to the music, is arresting and sucks the viewer in. Chapter 1 is all about the renaissance-style opulence and the costume design and styling is outstanding. (See 1:46) In Chapter 2 all the opulence is stripped right back to a bare scene but the film drives forward with a pacey edit. (See 6:55) Chapter 3 is about phases and transitions and the &#x2018;mirrored&#x2019; technique works well to tell that story. (See 10:57) "The sound design and build of the transition sequences are amazing in their own right and create breathing room between the three chapters. (See 4:00; 8:57) What I really want to commend is the attention to detail in this multi-layered film. There is a level of craft here that is often lacking in South African Music videos. I can see why it shot to the top of the Apple music video charts. As a filmmaker, Kyle is developing a sensibility that is his own and I won&#x2019;t be surprised his work pops up on a reference reel near you."
