 HONGQI ZHANG 123RF.comHighlights from the report include:Africa&#x2019;s strongest economies over the last two years have included commodity-importing East African countries Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda, while the West African economies of C te d&#x2019;Ivoire and Senegal have also emerged as star performers. A growing volume of capital is targeted at sub-Saharan Africa real estate investment and development, with a series of new investment vehicles being launched in recent years. South African funds are increasingly prominent as they seek to diversify away from their domestic market.Rapid population growth and urbanisation are key drivers of property market activity across sub-Saharan Africa. Its population is growing at a faster rate than that of any other global region and its demographic profile is both young and increasingly urbanised, creating opportunities for real estate development to support this growth.The retail property sector continues to be a major focus for development activity, causing the shopping mall concept to take root in an increasingly wide range of sub-Saharan cities with Nairobi remaining an important hotspot for development.Francophone West Africa has emerged a new focus for international retailers and developers, having previously lagged other parts of the continent. Increased retailer interest in this part of Africa has been highlighted by the French hypermarket Carrefour&#x2019;s entry into Abidjan, C te d&#x2019;Ivoire. Carrefour also made its debut in the Kenyan market in 2016. Mobile telecommunications have already had a transformative socio-economic impact in Africa by allowing large sections of the population to skip landlines and move straight to wireless technology. This market is only set to grow, which is set to have a huge effect on the growth of online retailing.Off the back of this increased demand the region&#x2019;s key cities are currently undersupplied for modern warehousing space. Several major logistics and industrial parks are in the pipeline as part of wider urban developments such as Rendeavour&#x2019;s Tatu City near Nairobi and Roma Park in Lusaka. Peter Welborn, chairman of Knight Frank Africa, said: &#x201c;Real estate demand stemming from oil companies and the associated service supply sector has eased in all the African oil-driven markets. Conversely, in the retail sector, the demand across Africa, from the growing middle classes has continued to create a marked increase in activity particularly in the Francophone countries. This increase in tenant demand has encouraged new schemes to be proposed; Abidjan (C te d&#x2019;Ivoire) providing a really good example as such a capital city where the proposed schemes are supported by offshore investors.&#x201d; &#x201c;With the increasing demand for the best commercial and residential accommodation coming from the growing Africa middle classes, there has been an increasing need for developers to raise the quality of the specification in all the new developments,&#x201d; said Welborn. He reiterated that, &#x201c;The challenge for both property developers and investor, is to ensure that the impact and timing of planned infrastructure projects on the growth of their capital city, is fully understood. The timing and the use mix being a key component to ensure real success.&#x201d; Africa rental indexCityCountryRent per m2 per monthLuandaAngolaUSD 80.00LagosNigeriaUSD 67.00N'DjamenaChadUSD 55.00MalaboEquatorial GuineaUSD 37.00CairoEgyptUSD 35.00LibrevilleGabonUSD 35.00AccraGhanaUSD 35.00AbujaNigeriaUSD 33.00AbidjanC te d'IvoireUSD 32.00AlgiersAlgeriaUSD 30.00MaputoMozambiqueUSD 27.50DoualaCameroonUSD 26.00KinshasaDR CongoUSD 25.00Addis AbabaEthiopiaUSD 25.00Yaound CameroonUSD 22.00Dar es SalaamTanzaniaUSD 21.00CasablancaMoroccoUSD 20.50KigaliRwandaUSD 20.00LusakaZambiaUSD 20.00BamakoMaliUSD 19.00DakarSenegalUSD 19.00Cape TownSouth Africa USD 18.00RabatMoroccoUSD 17.00JohannesburgSouth AfricaUSD 17.00KampalaUgandaUSD 17.00NairobiKenyaUSD 16.00AntananarivoMadagascarUSD 15.00Port LouisMauritiusUSD 15.00WindhoekNamibiaUSD 14.00NouakchottMauritaniaUSD 12.00GaboroneBotswanaUSD 11.50LilongweMalawi USD 11.00TunisTunisiaUSD 10.00HarareZimbabweUSD 10.00BlantyreMalawiUSD 5.50 Africa Yield IndexCountryCityYieldEthiopiaAddis Ababa6.00%KenyaNairobi8.00%ZimbabweHarare8.00%BotswanaGaborone8.25%MauritiusPort Louis8.50%MoroccoCasablanca8.50%NamibiaWindhoek8.50%South AfricaJohannesburg8.50%C te d'IvoireAbidjan9.00%GabonLibreville9.00%GhanaAccra9.00%MoroccoRabat9.00%NigeriaLagos9.00%South Africa Cape Town9.00%TanzaniaDar es Salaam9.00%NigeriaAbuja9.50%MalawiBlantyre9.75%AlgeriaAlgiers10.00%CameroonDouala10.00%CameroonYaound 10.00%ChadN'Djamena10.00%MozambiqueMaputo10.00%SenegalDakar10.00%UgandaKampala10.00%ZambiaLusaka10.00%EgyptCairo10.50%TunisiaTunis10.50%Equatorial GuineaMalabo11.00%MauritaniaNouakchott11.00%RwandaKigali11.00%DR CongoKinshasa12.00%Malawi Lilongwe12.00%MaliBamako12.00%AngolaLuanda14.00%MadagascarAntananarivo14.00%
