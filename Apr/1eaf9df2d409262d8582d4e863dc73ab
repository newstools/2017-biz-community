That&#x2019;s the case with the latest TV ad for iWyze insurance. I know I have given them an Orchid previously for another execution in this campaign &#x2013; which has the tagline: &#x201c;iWyze takes control when you can&#x2019;t&#x201d; &#x2013; but I think another is merited. [Orchids & Onions] Ensure you don't end up like a headless chicken... or spoil your grammarThank goodness that in the 22 years we've lived in our house, we've never had a burst geyser and its resulting flood...By Brendan Seery 28 Mar 2017 This time, the ad references the old adage about the ostrich burying its head in the sand as a way to avoid dealing with reality. So, we see a couple going through various stages in their life together &#x2013; and avoiding crucial questions at crucial times by figuratively burying their heads. And when they do that, they suddenly morph into ostriches. Screengrabs from the ad. So; the questions &#x2013; &#x201c;When are you two getting married&#x201d;; &#x201c;When are you having a baby&#x201d;; &#x201c;Honey, let&#x2019;s have another one;&#x201d; and, then the one all parents dread: &#x201c;Mommy, how did you put a baby in your tummy?&#x201d; &#x2013; provoke avoiding action. That is, right up until the day the young kids ask mom: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going to happen to us when you die?&#x201d; Then Mom remains Mom and doesn&#x2019;t become an ostrich, because she is with iWyze and knows that the insurance company will take control when she can&#x2019;t. So they will provide for the family&#x2019;s financial future when she or dad are no longer there. It&#x2019;s simple, it&#x2019;s effective and it speaks directly to the young families who should be taking out insurance. We&#x2019;ve always had life insurance &#x2013; although if you take out something like an endowment policy you will be fleeced (ask me, I know) &#x2013; but life insurance gives you the peace of mind of knowing that your kids will get the best shot at a future. So, for tapping into that ostrich adage and the fear of leaving your family destitute, this ad works as marketing communication. So another Orchid for iWyze and its agency, Joe Public. I do sometimes wonder, though, given the heterogeneous nature of our society whether using phrases, sayings and experiences from a Eurocentric perspective is always such a good idea&#x2026; Despite what some radical university students may say, science is not Eurocentric (throw away Isaac Newton at your peril, people)&#x2026; it is simply science. That fact may escape the revolutionaries but, generally speaking, science and maths escape many South Africans. Logic, she is not big in this country &#x2013; this is why you need fire pools (because it is well known people in rural areas need buckets to put out fires); why a former Eskom CEO can be offered R30 million after just 18 months in office; why Number One can fire a finance minister and be surprised by the consequences; why a financial adviser can advocate a policy of nationalising banks, insurance companies and mines, which has never worked anywhere else it has been tried &#x2013; and why there are those who demand that ratings agencies from the Brics countries assess our prospects&#x2026; It really galls me when I hear, or see, stupidity in an advertising context. Latest example is for Surge Africa, a company which makes devices to protect your sensitive electronics from lightning strikes or power surges. When you look at the company&#x2019;s website, you cannot fail to be impressed with its products and its ability. So, why did they get a moron to write the script for one of their latest radio ads? This promises us that Surge Africa&#x2019;s products will protect your equipment from &#x201c;thunder and lightning damage&#x201d;. Seriously. Basic Science 101 for the idiot copywriter who put that together: Lightning causes damage. Thunder, though it makes a big scary noise, is no threat to electronic equipment&#x2026; unless it goes off right next to a sensitive microphone. Again &#x2013; as so often in other cases where I have awarded an Onion &#x2013; I have to ask: who the hell approved this? If it was someone from Africa Surge, I would take my business to someone who understands science. If no-one from the company checked the script then I would worry about their attention to business detail. So, Africa Surge, nothing you can do to protect yourself from this Onion.
