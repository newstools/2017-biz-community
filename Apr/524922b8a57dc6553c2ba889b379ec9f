Jonathan 'Zapiro' Shapiro Photo: Bengt Oberger - WikipediaThis is according to the state's provisional indictment submitted in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court yesterday, 25 April 2017. The state alleges that the 23-year-olds were researching how to mount terrorist attacks in South Africa after their attempts to leave the country to join the Islamic State failed. Seven other alleged targets included King David High School in Linksfield, Johannesburg, and the diplomatic missions of the UK, the US and Russia, all in Pretoria. Plans for the attacks were allegedly made by the brothers between 2015 and their arrest on 9 July 2016. The state alleges that in August 2015 Tony-Lee contacted an IS network and others on messaging app Telegram and was ordered to "kill Zapiro who drew the Messenger of Allah cartoon". He was allegedly told that "South Africa was part of the war against terrorism in that it supplied weapons to Arab states and contributed to African Union military initiatives". The indictment said "South Africa was labelled as a 'great supporter and propagator of gays and democracy'." Source: The Times
