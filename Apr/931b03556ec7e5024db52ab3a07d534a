The ITF is an intergovernmental organisation with 57 member countries that facilitates global dialogue for better transport. It acts as a think tank for member governments and organises an annual summit of transport ministers. The CPB is the ITF&#x2019;s platform for engaging with the private sector and to enrich global transport policy discussion with a business perspective. With cumulative sales of more than 440,000 all-electric cars and vans since 2010, the alliance is a leader in zero-emission vehicles. Jos Viegas, secretary-general of the ITF, says: &#x201c;We are very proud to have the Renault-Nissan Alliance, a strong market leader in clean mobility and innovative technologies, join the CPB. The alliance, which has a strong vision of the vehicle of the future, is expected to contribute significantly to our work on decarbonising transport, electro-mobility and autonomous driving.&#x201d; CPB members The members of the ITF Corporate Partnership Board include Abertis, AB InBev, AeroMexico, Brisa, China Communications Construction Co.
