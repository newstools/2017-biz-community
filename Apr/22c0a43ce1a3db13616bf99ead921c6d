Says Lance Krom, founder and managing director of Phonefinder: &#x201c;We recently partnered with a number of budget-saving services in an effort to help our customers save even more&#x201d;. For a limited time only, Phonefinder is giving extra value to anyone who applies for an offering will now also receive one month of free RoadCover*, which is a service offering that manages a motor vehicle accident victim's claim with the Road Accidents Fund (RAF) from start to finish. According to Krom, the company's established and successful business model, which leverages its systems that enable consumers to compare cellular contract options, and its integrated online sales and marketing strategy that generates leads for the mobile network operators (MNO), has the potential to scale well across numerous other industry verticals. Key determinants &#x201c;From our experience and research we've established that affordability and price are the key determinants of cell phone contract purchases via our website,&#x201d; says Krom. &#x201c;Either consumers are unable to purchase the phone they want upfront, so they opt to use a contract to make it more affordable, or they switch providers based on who is offering the best value for money.&#x201d; Based on the success of Phonefinder&#x2019;s unbiased cell phone contract comparison service, which enables visitors to search every mobile contract deal available based on the type of handset they desire, their preferred network, monthly costs, data bundles and voice minutes, Krom is confident that the easy-to-use nature of these web-based comparison tools and the company's established eco-system will lead to similar success in the company's new venture. &#x201c;Our intention is then to replicate the model in other industry verticals in the near future,&#x201d; he concludes. *Valid to the first 5,000 applicants.
