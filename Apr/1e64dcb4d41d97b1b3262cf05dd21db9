Briefed by Toyota South Africa&#x2019;s senior manager: CS marketing operations, Francois Streicher, to create awareness for its Toyota Value Service and position it so that it is not regarded as an investment as opposed to an expense, the agency responded with an elegant and thought-provoking television commercial. Toyota Value Service is applicable to all Toyota vehicles older than five years from date of sale. Value Service promises a minimum discount of 10% on parts (excluding oil) and a labour rate capped at Service Plan rate. Furthermore Value Service follows the recommended service schedule for your Toyota, ensuring that only the necessary is done when due. Each service however includes a full inspection of safety critical and maintenance items, making it more than just a service. Conceived by creative director Tian Van den Heever, art director Tshepo Mosoeu and copywriter Thabang Manyelo under the guidance of group CEO and chief creative officer Brett Morris, the ad tastefully compares the human body to a Toyota. Using skillful camera angles from yourgirlfriend and fast-paced editing from Blade, the ad opens with shots of a strong but lean body and obviously fit and toned body running at pace through a suburb. As the figure sprints passed a parked bus, it is revealed that the runner is a mature woman working out. &#x201c;It is obvious from her body language and demeanor that she is strong and confident, despite &#x2013; as some would say &#x2013; her age,&#x201d; said van den Heever. &#x201c;This lady has invested in her health and maintaining her flexibility and strength, to the point where she draws admiring looks from the few pedestrians that are out and about. She&#x2019;s not aging gracefully, she&#x2019;s aging well &#x2013; just as your Toyota will if you take care of it.&#x201d; Credits: Client: Toyota Customer Services Product: Toyota Value Service Creative agency: FCB Joburg Reagen Kok &#x2013; Executive Business Unit Director Wendy Lundie &#x2013; Group Account director Chief Creative Officer/Group CEO: Brett Morris Creative Director: Tiaan van der Heever Copywriter Thabang Manyelo Art Director Tshepo Mosoeu Strategic planner: Stuart Simms TV production: Nakita Bolus Media planners: Gwen Bezuidenhout Production company: Yourgirlfriend Post production: Blade
