Hubert Barichievy's Pop-BustsHis background in sculpture started when he was commissioned by ZA News to turn South African satirist, Jonathan Shapiro&#x2019;s political caricatures in to three dimensional puppets for one of its famous online skits. Shortly after this successful venture, he started applying his knowledge and skills to his own creations. His passion for storytelling through art manifests itself in these polyurethane elastomer busts of famous pop culture heroes, each representing a struggle, a talent or a part of history. Barichievy was tasked with creating portrait busts out of cheddar cheese as part of a marketing campaign for Parmalat on behalf of its agency, Fox P2. It was then that he realised not only his talent for sculpture but also his passion for it. The initial three muses, created a few years ago, were instantly recognisable artists themselves, namely Frida Kahlo, Andy Warhol and Salvador Dali. Subsequently the series has been extended to incorporate other significant people of the 20th and 21st century such as Desmond Tutu, Banksy, Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein.
