YouTube star Colin Furze was tasked by BBC Worldwide to build something fast from something incredibly slow for The Stig to put through its paces to celebrate the return of the world&#x2019;s biggest motoring entertainment show. Despite the average speed of a dodgem car being around 5mph, The Stig was able to increase that twentyfold thanks to Furze's engineering and the addition of a 100 horsepower, 600cc Honda motorbike engine. Lucia Sinigagliesi, the Guinness World Records adjudicator said: &#x201c;We&#x2019;re all used to seeing The Stig driving at high speeds &#x2013; but he&#x2019;s usually in a sports car and usually on a race track. To see him hurtle past in a classic bumper car at 100mph was surreal, but hugely impressive. Equally as impressive are the engineering expertise of Furze &#x2013; the combination of their skills makes for record-breaking fun.&#x201d;
