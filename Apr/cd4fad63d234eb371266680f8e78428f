This signals a new chapter in the CEO SleepOut brand that is also a world first. The venue is also fitting, as this is where the historic Women&#x2019;s March took place to the then-Apartheid seat of government in protest against the carrying of passes. The MEC for the Gauteng education department, Panyaza Lesufi, introduces the new brand ambassadors for this year's Schools SleepOut. CEO SleepOut brand ambassador and MC at an event that launched the idea of the &#x2018;SHeEO&#x2019; held at the Zone in Rosebank, Leanne Manas, says this is an opportunity for female leaders to showcase themselves, as well as for male leaders to nominate female leaders to participate. Also launched at the event was beneficiaries for 2017. The main focus this year is on shelter for children, so the primary beneficiary is the Door of Hope. Announced by Luke Lamprecht, a child development and protection consultant with 25 years in the field, Lamprecht explains that primary shelter is a pillar of the CEO SleepOut. &#x201c;The Constitution protects children, but if their most basic right of right is not met then no rights exist or come about, such as education, for them.&#x201d; He says a baby can die on the street quite easily. &#x201c;The reality is that abandonment is the cause of a range of issues from family planning to substance abuse, but it does not change the fact that this can lead to the death of a child.&#x201d; June = SleepOut Month The criteria to be selected as a beneficiary are very strict and the beneficiary went through a robust process. &#x201c;This year&#x2019;s primary beneficiary was chosen, amongst other reasons, on its ability to articulate a legacy that would see children calling it home, even when they leave.&#x201d; Yusuf Abramjee, chief SleepOut brand ambassador and social activist, says June will be the SleepOut month, with the Sympathy SleepOut and the South African SleepOut taking place during this time. &#x201c;This is a national call to action to go and SleepOut in the month of June.&#x201d; He urged everyone to also donate, from nappies to toilet paper.
