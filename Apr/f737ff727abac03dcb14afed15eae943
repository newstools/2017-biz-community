She will also showcase some of her productions in partnership with Accra[dot]Alt and the African Women&rsquo;s Development Fund (AWDF).&nbsp; Perkins will premiere her most recent documentary Black Panther Woman at the AWDF offices (East Legon) and an episode of the award-winning series Redfern Now at Brazil House (Jamestown). The films, free to the public, have been selected to provide a window into the identity and character of contemporary Australia with themes including migration, Indigenous issues, humour and drama. &nbsp; This is her first opportunity to travel in Africa and she is delighted to be sharing some of the highlights of Aboriginal cinema with audiences in Ghana.&nbsp; High Commissioner Andrew Barnes commented: &ldquo;We are very proud to have Rachel Perkins for the first time in Ghana. It&rsquo;s a wonderful opportunity for Ghanaians to see a unique selection of films that showcase the diversity of Australia&rsquo;s people and landscape.&rdquo;&nbsp;
