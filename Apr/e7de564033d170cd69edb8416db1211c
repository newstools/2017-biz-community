Africa&#x2019;s first gay streaming video-on-demand (VOD) channel is embracing its new incarnation in 2017 as a &#x2018;lifestyle destination&#x2019;. Further expanding its emerging position within the LGBT community is the hosting of competitions that feature luxury items, including a Mercedes-Benz G-Class cross-country vehicle. &#x201c;Following its 2016 launch, our current focus is about responding to the LGBT community&#x2019;s multi-layered needs that go above and beyond simple streaming of video premium content,&#x201d; explained Joanne Raphael Katz, spokesperson for PrideTV. &#x201c;Our free video content is important in the storytelling of the community and its needs.&#x201d; PrideTV provides the LGBT community - no matter where they might be - with a growing library of LGBT movies and series currently numbering over 200 titles. The service can be viewed on smart televisions, desktop computers, laptops, tablets or mobile phones using either iOS or Android operating systems. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re working hard to ensure that it is the first online resource accessed by community members each day. It&#x2019;s no longer a single website, but a true LGBT portal,&#x201d; concludes Katz. For more information, go to PrideTV.co.za.
