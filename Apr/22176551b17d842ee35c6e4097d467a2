 Dmitriy Shironosov 123RF.comThe world&#x2019;s top companies are increasingly introducing mindfulness practices into their organisations to help employees reduce stress and anxiety, increase focus and attention, and ultimately enhance productivity &#x201c;South African companies are starting to follow suit,&#x201d; says Debbie Goodman-Bhyat, author, speaker and CEO of Jack Hammer. &#x201c;Mindfulness is no longer an opaque concept reserved for yoga retreats and motivational memes. The concept and practice has found grateful and receptive audiences in many of the world&#x2019;s leading companies, including here in South Africa. &#x201c;The idea that people who practice mindfulness principles might be on the fringes of society belongs to a past era and there is now enough data, research and scientific information supporting not only the personal, but also commercial benefits of a more in-tune, holistic approach to life and work. &#x201c;Mindfulness is a global movement, pioneered by PhD Professor of Medicine Emeritus, Jon Kabat-Zinn. It is increasingly becoming mainstream and a growing number of top leaders are starting to incorporate mindfulness-based practices and principles in their personal and professional lives.&#x201d; International adoption Mindfulness programmes and practices are known to have been introduced at some high-profile organisations, including Google, Intel, Aetna, Keurig Green Mountain and Target. Global studies conducted on international organisations (including Fortune 500 companies) show a 19% decrease in stress, 37% increase in productivity, 40% increase in focus, 34% increase in emotional control and 37% decrease in being overwhelmed in companies where mindfulness practices have been introduced. In addition, a recent study found that participants in 6-9 week mindfulness courses experience a 42% stress reduction, as well as improvement in productivity, time management and job satisfaction. Local publication Locally, Goodman-Bhyat recently published &#x2018;IntheFlow &#x2013; Taking Mindfulness to Work&#x2019;, the result of her years of research into the impact of implementing mindfulness practices in the workplace. It went into the business best-seller list, with business leaders enthusiastically backing the 6-prompt formula that forms the basis of the guide. Allon Raiz, CEO of Raizcorp, noted that Goodman-Bhyat had managed to build the bridge between the hectic chaos of everyday business and the clarity and serenity that being present, and in the moment, brings. &#x201c;The book takes an ethereal concept and makes it practical for people to understand and more importantly, to apply.&#x201d; Goodman-Bhyat says introducing mindfulness practices in the workplace does not take massive amounts of time, strategising or financial investment. &#x201c;However, it does take commitment and championing by leaders, who are invested in shifting perspectives and changing the status quo of &#x2018;how we do things around here&#x2019;. When this happens, impact on an organisation&#x2019;s wellness &#x2013; from individual level to company performance, is indisputable.&#x201d; Following the lead of their global counterparts, South African organisations are also starting to pay attention to the benefits of incorporating mindfulness-based programmes and principles in their work environments. Large corporations such as Woolworths and Old Mutual, as well as medium-sized and entrepreneurial businesses are investigating options for mindfulness-based training, leadership development or group learning sessions. &#x201c;Further, more executive education, MBA and leadership development courses conducted at South Africa&#x2019;s top tertiary institutions are offering mindfulness training, as an integral part of their curricula, so it is inevitable that the concepts will start trickling into the business environment,&#x201d; concludes Goodman-Bhyat.
