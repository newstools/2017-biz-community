Fresh will take over the reins as Metro FM's new breakfast show host from today and has said that he is ready for the journey ahead. Speaking on 5FM, the radio veteran revealed that he was told about moving to Metro late last week and had grabbed the opportunity with both hands. "It was a no-brainer, but it was also bittersweet because I have a family here [5FM]. I have built a family for 11 years."

Fresh recalled his journey on 5FM, including how it had been his goal to host both drive-time shows on the station even before he joined. "When I was at YFM I was building towards that. And I have done that and I feel like it's time to move on, it's time for new blood." Fresh said for three months after joining 5FM he had nightmares every night about messing up during his show. "But, for Metro I am more excited. There is zero fear. It's a 30-year-long dream and, like I said, for me it's important to do this." Fresh's resignation on Friday afternoon came just hours after Metro FM morning co-host Unathi Msengana announced that she was leaving the station. The news also came a week after former Metro FM breakfast show host Glen Lewis announced his exit from the station to join Tbo Touch's internet radio station Touch HD. The SABC declined to comment on individual shuffles and departures, stating that it would make all announcements about its new line-up within the next few days. Source: The Times
