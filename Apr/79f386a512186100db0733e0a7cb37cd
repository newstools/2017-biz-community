Phil RantaWith a YouTube network of over 1,200 creators receiving over 6bn monthly views, Studio71 has become a leader in digital brand solutions, premium content creation including movies and television programmes, and talent management. Ranta commented, &#x201c;Digital influencers have revolutionised the advertising industry, through the creation of authentic branded content attached to loyal fan bases. I am honoured to work with LIA to shine a light on the best work in this booming sector.&#x201d; The hours spent in front of the TV or reading the newspaper or magazines are now hours spent in front of a computer, a tablet or a phone. There is a new generation of artists emerging from these platforms. One that own their audience, analyse data and create content that reaches all kinds of demographics around the world&#x2026; the social influencer. These influencers hold the key for brands and marketers to get their message out to a large audience quickly. With social media marketing expenditure likely to increase by $10bn in the US alone over the next three years, many companies are turning to these modern platforms for their next advertising campaign. The newly established relationship between social influencer, brand and agency is one of importance. &#x201c;In 2004, LIA removed the word &#x2018;advertising&#x2019; from the competition's name to reflect the fact that we observe more than just &#x2018;advertising&#x2019; in this ever-changing industry,&#x201d; stated Barbara Levy, president of LIA. &#x201c;We are proud to be the first major award show to recognise the importance of online branded entertainment, created by social media influencers. As social media continues to grow, it is crucial that we keep up with the current state of the industry.&#x201d; The entry system is open for entries, with an initial entry deadline of 9 June 2017.
