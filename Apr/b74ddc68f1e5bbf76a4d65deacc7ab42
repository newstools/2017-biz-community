He has just released a new single &#x201c;Star&#x201d; and is having his own show at Hillcrest Quarry in Durbanville Cape Town on 26 April with Sweet Resistance. The show kicks off at 7pm with tickets costing R150, available from Webtickets or the door. I caught up with Mark last week in the middle of rehearsals and got some fun, honest answers. What does music mean to you? I like to describe it as a very special gift. Something God gave to me, so that I could enjoy it on my own and even share it with others. It never stops giving me joy. I just can&#x2019;t see myself without it. Any funny moments on stage? So many! They happen so often that it&#x2019;s difficult to just mention one. One of my personal favourites was the time myself and my manager engaged in a bet. At the time, during this particular tour, I really felt that no matter what I say to the crowd, that they were so enthusiastic, that they would cheer, no matter what I say to them. He felt that this was not true, so he bet me a fair sum of money to prove it, on his terms. We had just finished watching the classic Superman movie from the 80s. The one where the bad guy yells at Superman to &#x201c;Kneel before General Zod!&#x201d; My challenge was to somehow successfully place into my crowd talks the phrase, &#x201c;kneel before General Haze&#x201d;. At the near-end point of the show, the crowd was completely off the chain. I riled them up and dropped the line. The band couldn&#x2019;t believe I actually did it &#x2013; they just about fell to the ground laughing, as they&#x2019;d thought that I&#x2019;d chickened out, being so late in the show. Sure enough, the crowd loved it and cheered even more. Your heroes? Eric Clapton; Steven Tyler from Aerosmith; Freddie Mercury from Queen; The Beatles; Tina Turner; Ray Charles; Michael Jackson - I think that these people really are the sounds that moulded me into what I sound like today. What is your most treasured possession? My 2005 American Standard Fender Stratocaster. It looks just like Clapton&#x2019;s &#x201c;Blackie&#x201d; from the early 90s and it&#x2019;s the guitar that I&#x2019;ve wanted my whole childhood and still love to play now. It&#x2019;s your round what are you drinking? Double Johnny Walker on the rocks. The song you wished you wrote? &#x201c;The Show Must Go On&#x201d; by Queen. What makes you stand out? I try my best to work harder than anyone else. This business is all about &#x201c;the next big thing&#x201d;, when it should be about how the music matters above all else. Nicknames? General Haze (my band loves that one) Marky Hazey If you were not a musician what would you do? At the moment apparently, it&#x2019;s easy being the president in our country. No need to actually make sense or be accountable to the public. Pick five words to describe yourself? Loudmouth Artist Love Real Fun What song changed your life? &#x201c;Bohemian Rhapsody&#x201d; by Queen - I had no idea that it was possible to blend so many different styles and voices into one song &#x2013; pure genius! Favourite fashion garment? Shoes &#x2013; gimme gimme gimme! Top of your bucket list? Learn how to fly a helicopter. What do you complain about most often? Traffic and stupid people. Happiness is? Biltong while watching Star Wars. LINKS Mark Haze YouTube Channel: www.youtube.com/user/12thAvenueband Facebook: MARK HAZE Twitter: @RealMarkHaze Instagram: @RealMarkHaze Website: www.markhaze.com
