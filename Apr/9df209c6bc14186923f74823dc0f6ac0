Yes, I&#x2019;m sure. &#x2018;Revert&#x2019; is not a synonym for &#x2018;get back to&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s also not another word for &#x2018;set of changes&#x2019;. So when you type, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll check with client and revert.&#x201d; or &#x201c;How many reverts does this quote include?&#x201d; you&#x2019;re bastardising an innocent verb. To clarify, if something &#x2018;reverts&#x2019;, it is undone, changed to the way it was before, or (in software) rolled back. It goes back to a previous state, condition or practice: &#x201c;He reverted to his native language.&#x201d; Note: There is already a &#x2018;back&#x2019; implied there, so &#x2018;revert back&#x2019; is like saying &#x2018;chai tea&#x2019; (i.e. redundant). And yet&#x2026; The widespread mis-use of this verb for nefarious purposes infuriates me more than those who use &#x2018;loose&#x2019; when they mean &#x2018;lose&#x2019;. So many people use &#x2018;revert&#x2019; incorrectly that those, like me, who have sleepless nights about misplaced apostrophes, are marginalised. We become &#x2018;grammar Nazis&#x2019;, consigned to the realm of puritanical spelling-correcters. The problem is that languages change with use and it&#x2019;s not the fittest of the language that survives. In this respect, evolution does not always mean progress, so I believe that, eventually, the incorrect use of &#x2018;revert&#x2019; will become standard (like &#x2018;literally&#x2019;), unless we change how we use it now. So, please, for the continued peace of my editorial soul and, more importantly, for the future of the English language, I beg you: Use &#x2018;revert&#x2019; properly.
