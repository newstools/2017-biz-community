&#x201c;Africa Property Skyline magazine is in line with our mission to enhance and encourage real estate investment in Africa,&#x201d; says Kfir Rusin, API Events, managing director. Launched at the recently held East Africa Property Investment Summit in Nairobi, the first edition is available online at www.AfricanSkylineMag.com, the cover of which features the new World Trade Centre in Abuja. &#x201c;We also take a look at both the funding and valuation climates in African property, and we delve into the details of new asset classes like healthcare facilities, as well as the challenges faced in quantity surveying and cost management on the continent,&#x201d; Rusin adds.
