 dolgachov 123rf.com&#x201c;Following a first round of co-creation and innovation work with students and industry at the end of 2016, we proved a case for further investment and we are now more determined than ever to pull together the local digital health ecosystem and see some really innovative and locally created solutions go to market,&#x201d; says Derrick Kotze, CEO, mLab Southern Africa. He adds that vibrant ecosystems don&#x2019;t work with only a handful of partners and that the call remains open for industry, both public and private, with an interest in health and wellness to join the initiative. The second phase of the initiative kicks off with another season of DEMOLA, and brings together more local and international industry, SMMEs and multidisciplinary students to develop solutions for real mHealth and wellness challenges. 'Our main aims are to establish a vibrant community and unlock the potential of mHealth in South Africa through innovation and entrepreneurship. To create a public lab for innovators that will lower the barrier of access to technology. To provide a systemic approach to innovation using adapted innovation techniques within the national system of innovation. And to fully commit to youth empowerment in partnership with local and international industry through co-creation opportunities,&#x201d; concludes Kotze.
