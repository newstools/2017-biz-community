FHI President and CEO Yasuyuki Yoshinaga commented, "This change in company name declares Subaru's determination to thrive as a brand that delivers value. When customers are satisfied, we see happy faces. We want to encourage even more smiles and create even more Subaru fans." Termination of industrial products business In the "Prominence 2020" mid-term management vision announced in May 2014, FHI set "enhancing the Subaru brand" as one of its primary goals. Reinforcing human resources capable of making immediate contributions, especially in the engineering and product development divisions of the Subaru automotive business, has been a key initiative for accelerating efforts to achieve this goal. After a comprehensive reexamination of FHI's business portfolio, the decision was made to terminate the industrial products business and concentrate management resources in the automotive business. The industrial products business presently manufactures and sells a wide range of products, including general-purpose engines for construction, industrial, and agricultural equipment; high-performance engines for snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and other vehicles; and finished goods such as generators and pumps.
