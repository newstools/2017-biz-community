 ximagination 123RF.comIn 2016, the Fund disbursed R80 million in scholarships to 2000 students in universities across South Africa. Two thousand, two hundred and fifty scholarships will be allocated to South African students, while 750 will go to students in the Barclays Africa operating regions outside South Africa. Five hundred of the local scholarships will be granted to Absa staff member dependents. The Barclays Africa operations outside of South Africa will begin rolling out their 2017 scholarship programmes when their academic year commences in September. The CEO Scholarship Fund forms part of the education and skills development pillar of Barclays Africa&#x2019;s shared growth strategy through which it has undertaken to invest R1.4 billion in education and skills training between 2016 and 2018. Education and skills development, enterprise development and financial inclusion are the three pillars of shared growth, which aims to create shared value for communities and stakeholders. Barclays Africa Group&#x2019;s chief executive, Maria Ramos, said, &#x201c;University education unlocks opportunities that can change the lives of young people and the future of our continent. This is an expression of our shared growth commitment to help realize Africa's potential and contribute to long-term economic growth. This investment has been made possible by the hard work and dedication of colleagues in our business and I am proud of their commitment to making a visible difference in the lives of thousands of young Africans.&#x201d; Using a combination of academic performance and financial need, universities identify qualifying students and disburse the funds after consultation with Absa. Many of the qualifying students either have very limited financial resources or fall within the &#x2018;missing middle&#x2019; category of students whose parents or guardians can only afford to pay a portion of the required university fees. Successful applicants will also benefit from the leadership and psychosocial support offered by the programme.
