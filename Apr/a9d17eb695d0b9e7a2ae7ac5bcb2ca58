If Uber does not comply it could face a fine of &#x20ac;10,000 ($10,600) for each day it remains in defiance of the court. Shocked by the ruling Uber said it was shocked by the ruling and that it would appeal immediately, seeking suspension of the ruling. The court's ruling follows a decision by a court in Milan two years ago to ban the company's UberPop application, which was deemed under Italian law to encourage the provision of taxi services by unlicensed drivers. That ruling was upheld in a subsequent court case in Turin. Source: AFP
