Growing Greener Generations Further to the biogas plant, Corona Farm will be divided into separate commercial units. One unit for the Waste to Energy project and the rest of the units to new sustainable organic farms with the focus on ownership for young entrepreneurs, primarily from previously disadvantaged backgrounds. Five of these units have already been developed with plantings of table and wine grapes, as well as citrus. An additional two units are in the process of being planted.

Furthermore, Reliance has combined efforts with Skills Fusion and the Department of Agriculture in training new agriculture students over the next 12 months. The company&#x2019;s mission is to Grow Greener Generations, and these new initiatives can be seen as a reflection of the company ethos. Reliance has expanded operations into the Southern and Eastern Cape, with the opening of its new compost facility at Humansdorp recently.
