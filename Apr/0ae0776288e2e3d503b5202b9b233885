&#x201c;2017 marks Markex's 30th year and we&#x2019;ll pull out all the stops to ensure that the show maintains its position as the place to be for all things promo,&#x201d; says Nick Sarnadas, event director: Madex 2017, Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery. &#x201c;In order to mark the occasion, we&#x2019;ll be launching our brand-new Madex expo at the same time, the continent&#x2019;s only dedicated marketing show, providing huge value for visitors interested in getting to grips with the full spectrum of marketing offerings, from digital and social media, to PR, design and advertising.&#x201d; Markex 2017 will feature an invite-only trade-focused Reseller Zone, as well as catering for corporate buyers&#x2019; needs within the Markex General/ Madex section of the hall, where entrance will be free for pre-registered delegates. A nominal fee of R50 will be required for those wanting to pre-register onsite for the general section of the show without a business card. &#x201c;Aside from getting their hands on next-gen products, Markex visitors can use the show to compare and shortlist product and services within a much faster time frame, deepen relationships with current suppliers and strike up new partnerships. &#x201c;With two seminar theatres, focusing on today&#x2019;s pressing issues within both the promo and marketing sectors, as well as the new cinema theatre, attendees don&#x2019;t need to go far to catch up on the latest in market trends, for free!&#x201d; Sarnadas explains. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re also putting together a bigger, better New Product Display area, for a close-up look at the hottest products at the show, as well as a daily activity newsletter, which will include information on the demos, functions and competitions that exhibitors will be holding on their stands during the show.&#x201d; Corporate visitors are invited to click on www.markex.co.za and follow the quick, easy registration to ensure free access to the general section of the show, which is running from 7 to 8 June this year at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg.
