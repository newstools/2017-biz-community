Functionality Entry Ninja&#x2019;s functionality enables a customer to create and save a personal profile. This means event entries can be finalised quickly and conveniently, eliminating the need to fill in a myriad of personal and contact information for each new sporting event a customer wishes to register for. &#x201c;We were actively looking to extend into event registration so as to better service our customers through the approximately 1000 Computicket outlets,&#x201d; commented Joseph Bronn, deputy chief operating officer for the group. Team entries, timing facility Entry Ninja&#x2019;s service extends to different types of sporting events, plus it makes allowance for team entries and offers event organisers a timing facility. With its experience in processing large transaction volumes as well as its vast distribution network, Computicket has now set its sights on servicing mass sporting events via Entry Ninja&#x2019;s system. Understanding the customer requirements within this market segment is critical, therefore Entry Ninja&#x2019;s management team and small staff compliment will continue running the day-to-day business operations.
