Beautiful News is founded by photographer and filmmaker Adrian Steirn, who was the visionary of the 21 Icons project, in which Grapevine were the publicists for seasons two and three. Ginkgo Agency has once again appointed Grapevine to promote its vision to generate positive conversations about ordinary citizens who show generosity and kindness towards their neighbours, symbolise triumph over adversity or provide inspiration within their communities. Steirn comments, &#x201c;Grapevine formed and integral part of 21 Icons and has been selected as the PR consultancy of choice to promote Beautiful News due to the successful roll out of 21 Icons Season II and Season III. The Grapevine team approached the project with great passion and enthusiasm, allowing the public to access and reflect on the extraordinary men and women who led South Africa&#x2019;s journey to democracy and we believe they will embark on this journey with the same approach, commitment and professionalism that we experienced while working with them before.&#x201d; The platform is visually and emotionally gripping, demonstrating the agency&#x2019;s heart to capture untold stories through videos that are published at 4.14pm daily. The timeslot recognises the moment Nelson Mandela was released from prison on 11 February 1990. Visit www.beautifulnews.co.za
