I felt a sense of betrayal &#x2013; why had they not told me? Well, once I had done a little research, it turns out that they had informed me; I did receive an e-mail, but the headline news wasn't about the halving of the rewards, instead, the focus was on &#x201c;personalised discounts&#x201d; and &#x201c;get the app&#x201d; &#x2013; and then below that, &#x201c;remember you now earn 1 point for every R2 spent&#x201d;. What they didn&#x2019;t mention was that this was previously 1 point for every R1 spent, so while they launched the programme with much fanfare, there was no real noise or transparency with regards to this major change. That said, I decided to check out the personalised discounts &#x2013; and yes, their data was very good; they definitely know what I buy, and the discounts offered were very attractive. I downloaded the app, but then saw that I need to redeem the vouchers before they expire; so for me it's all a bit of a schlep. Plus I now feel that I am being cajoled and pushed with messages of &#x2018;don&#x2019;t miss out&#x2019; and &#x2018;get moving&#x2019;, and then there are the 100 other specials that are being shoved at me&#x2026; Where I initially saw Smart Shopper as a true win-win for both the retailer and the customer, now reading between the lines, this move appears to be more business than customer-focused. The initial customer responses echo this sentiment. Most having been less than positive with comments ranging from &#x201c;I&#x2019;m off to Spar&#x201d; to &#x201c;more down ratings&#x201d; to &#x201c;junk status&#x201d;. With estimates of 10.7-million* cardholders the Smart Shopper is said to be South Africa&#x2019;s largest loyalty programme by member numbers. I would guess that the large majority will remain as I was, ignorant to the fact that the basic offer has changed dramatically, and that there will be little impact in the short term. However, the primary objective of a loyalty programme is that of customer retention, and here only the long term will confirm the status of the Smart Shopper card. Clearly the success of the business is the primary driver, but as with most things in life, it&#x2019;s not just what you do, it&#x2019;s how you do it &#x2013; and customer experience should never be overlooked. *Moneyweb
