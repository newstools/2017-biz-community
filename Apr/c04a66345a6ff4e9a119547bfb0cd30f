Now in its third year, the competition challenges young creative communications professionals to present a core idea, including a launch event/activation, digital activation and video idea, aimed to be launched on World Pneumonia Day, 12 November. &#x201c;The medical sector is advancing rapidly. Creativity can save lives. That is why we need to harness young talent from the industry to win the battle against pneumonia - the cause of most children&#x2019;s deaths from disease worldwide. Together with our partner &#x2018;la Caixa&#x2019; Foundation, we are delighted to raise the profile of the issue on the global stage of Lions Health to make sure that every child survives pneumonia,&#x201d; says G rard Bocquenet, director, private fundraising and partnerships, Unicef. Submission criteria Submissions should work across multiple channels and be scalable globally or locally to generate public engagement and raise awareness of the fight against pneumonia. In doing so, the campaign should encourage advocacy and be driven by a long-term strategy. Speaking at the launch, Louise Benson, executive festival director, Lions Health said, &#x201c;We see time and again that creativity can make a difference and Lions Health embodies this belief. This competition looks to young marketers from around the world to draw on their creativity to raise awareness and be part of a project that will save lives.&#x201d; &#x201c;This project is a great example of the crossover between inventiveness and healthcare. Professionals in the creative healthcare communications industry have a wealth of knowledge and it is great to be able to provide young creatives with an opportunity to bring their ideas to a global audience with Unicef at Lions Health,&#x201d; said Ariadna Bardolet, international programmes department director, &#x2018;la Caixa&#x2019; Foundation.
