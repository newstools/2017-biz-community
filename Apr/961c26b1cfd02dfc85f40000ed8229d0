Passengers demanded answers&#x201a; and refunds&#x201a; from bus companies including City to City&#x201a; Translux and Greyhound. Troubled commuters Themba Jack&#x201a; at Cape Town Station waiting to travel to Port Elizabeth&#x201a; did not know if he would get home in time to prepare for an important church event. He was told to wait for two hours before he could collect a refund. He booked a City to City ticket on 6 April 2017. &#x201c;I am in a hurry. I need an alternative [and] my money is with them&#x201a;&#x201d; he said. Chiedza Gochera was shocked to find no buses for her trip to Harare&#x201a; Zimbabwe&#x201a; at Park Station, Johannesburg. &#x201c;I am unhappy. I am travelling with my daughter and I fear for her safety and mine &#x2026; This is such an inconvenience and nothing was communicated to us about the strike. I will have to buy another ticket and hopefully Greyhound will refund me&#x201a;&#x201d; she said. Alex Wilson&#x2019;s plan to visit his brother in Cape Town was scuppered at an empty bus terminal in Durban. The 28-year-old Malawian national from the Bluff spent R670 on his ticket and was due to board an Intercape bus at 9.30am. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m disappointed that I&#x2019;m no longer going. I was going to spend two weeks but I will have to make another plan to get there&#x201a;&#x201d; he said. Caster Mathebula&#x201a; 30&#x201a; of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga&#x201a; was also left in the lurch in Durban. He had booked a ticket with Greyhound to travel to Johannesburg. Unions, employers meeting Unions representing striking workers met employers yesterday afternoon in a bid to reach an agreement that could end the strike. Autopax spokesman Nozipho Jafta said: &#x201c;We have not been able to operate any of our services today. So what we have done&#x201a; those who want a refund&#x201a; and where we have cash&#x201a; we were able to refund them or told them to come back tomorrow.&#x201d; Refunds were a sore point for many. Nokulunga Bokvel&#x201a; who booked a City to City bus from Cape Town to Queenstown in Eastern Cape&#x201a; had to borrow R170 to make alternative travel arrangements. &#x201c;I booked a return ticket but they said they can only refund me for one&#x201a; for now and we will have to see later. I had to ask someone from work [for the extra R170]&#x201a;&#x201d; said Bokvel. Unions are demanding a 12% wage increase. &#x201c;From the time we began mediation ... they have not demonstrated any commitment to engage meaningfully with the demands&#x201a;&#x201d; a union spokesman said.
