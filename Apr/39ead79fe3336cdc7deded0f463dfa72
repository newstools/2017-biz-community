The Johannesburg show is included as part of the sold out &#x201c;The Great Circle 2017&#x201d; World Tour, featuring the group in its classic line-up. The world tour kicked off in mid-April and Midnight Oil will be performing over 30 gigs around the world reaching Johannesburg on Saturday the 29th of July. During the world tour they will share festival stages with artists like Arcade Fire, Sting and The Pixies. Release of &#x201c;The Full Tank&#x201d; CD box set The band have also announced the impending release of a remastered CD box set called &#x201c;The Full Tank&#x201d; featuring all of their existing albums and EP&#x2019;s plus a mammoth new 4 CD/8 DVD trove called &#x201c;The Overflow Tank&#x201d; which will include over 14 hours of previously unreleased and rare material. Both of these box sets will be housed in replica miniature water tanks like the one featured onstage at so many &#x2018;Oils&#x2019; gigs. The band also unveiled their first ever complete Vinyl collection which will feature 11 remastered LP&#x2019;s and two 12&#x201d; EP&#x2019;s all cut at Abbey Rd Studios in London. The three box sets will be released around the start of the tour but full track-listings and pre-orders are available on their website. In keeping with the band&#x2019;s longstanding commitments, their carbon footprint during &#x201c;The Great Circle&#x201d; World Tour will, of course, be fully offset and sustainability initiatives will be undertaken at all shows. Midnight Oil will also continue their collaborations with local and international environmental organisations including Greenpeace, supporting their campaigns on crucial issues like dangerous climate change and the imminent threats to Australia&#x2019;s Great Barrier Reef. At one level &#x201c;The Great Circle 2017&#x201d; simply reflects the geographic reality that the tour will loop around the world and circle Australia. At another level the name clearly implies the planet itself but it has a further meaning too. Sailors, and airmen use &#x201c;the great circle&#x201d; to navigate the globe because on a sphere the shortest distance between two points is not usually a straight line. How appropriate for a group who has always been deeply engaged with the world around them but whose career path has never been linear. Midnight Oil is more than just a rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;roll band. In 2017 they will finally bring things back to where they all began. The circle remains unbroken.
