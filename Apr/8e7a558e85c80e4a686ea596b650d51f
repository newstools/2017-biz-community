We are also planning to install street lights to improve the safety of our people, especially women and children,&#x201d; said Masina. To date, a total of 9,943 households have been electrified in informal settlements such as Langaville, Inxiweni, Marikana, Winnie Mandela and Ekurhuleni. The installation of streetlights is currently being rolled out with 2,263 streets lights of the targeted 3,000 and 156 High Mast Lights already installed. The mayor said they are working tirelessly to achieve the targeted 400 High Mast Lights around Ekurhuleni&#x2019;s 119 informal settlements. Improving household lighting for the poor requires stability in energy sources. Plans are currently underway to create the necessary settlement structures that would make safe and secure electricity connection possible. These plans include the implementation of alternative and renewable energy to limit dependence on the national grid and improve security of energy, while protecting the environment by limiting greenhouse emissions.
