Burger King gave away a total of 1500 whoppers vouchers over two days. The first Swhopper Day took place on McDonald&#x2019;s 21st birthday in SA, part coincidence, but mostly because we&#x2019;re cheeky like that. Lucas van Vuuren, executive creative director at Jupiter CT, says, &#x201c;The 'Swhopper' idea was born out of a broader 'Whopper Envy' TTL campaign. We needed a strong engagement piece tailored for social media to accompany our campaign. Good timing was essential to the success of 'Swhopper'. We actually moved the launch date earlier to take advantage of McD's birthday. &#x201c;Partnering with Techsys was great. They were keen and did what needed to be done. The stars aligned and everyone worked their asses off. The campaign was a great example of different disciplines and agencies coming together and producing stand-out work.&#x201d; Taking digital lead, Techsys Digital created a moderation dashboard where entries could be managed and published on the microsite, and winners could be drawn on both Swhopper Days. Andrew Walmsley, MD of Techsys, explains how it all came together behind the scenes. &#x201c;Winners received an SMS with a Wicode which they were able to redeem at any Burger King branch within 24 hours. We worked with Yonder to handle the Wicode integration." The campaign was a whopper of a success with a total of 4,057 entries received over the two days! Now that&#x2019;s what we call a swhoppalicious campaign! Like the sound of this and want to partner with Techsys on a project? Contact us today on 021 788 6896 or az.oc.syshcet&#64;ofni .
