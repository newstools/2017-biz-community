Perfect for petrolheads, the precision driving experience is presented by Grant McCleery, renowned racing car driver and multiple SA champion on both two and four wheels. McCleery is bringing the full range of newly launched Opel vehicles to the gymkhana track. Sign up on Rand Show weekends (remember your valid driver's licence), and climb behind the wheel of the 2017 Car of the Year winner, the Opel Astra, and the all-new Opel Mokka X, or choose an Opel Corsa or Adam. Out on the track, instructors will take visitors for a brief advanced driving session where they'll hone their precision driving skills.
