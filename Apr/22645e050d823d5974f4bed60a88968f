Do not floor the accelerator. Putting strain on your engine during the break-in period is not recommended. Consult the manual to find out how many kilometres the break-in period is for your specific car. Light throttle application is key. Do not shift gears at redline. Not pushing your new car over 4000rpm is advised. Even performance vehicles such as the Nissan GT-R should not be driven hard for the first 300 miles and Nissan doesn&#x2019;t recommend giving over 50 percent of throttle. Some performance vehicles (such as the Acura NSX) undergo the engine break-in process in the factory, so it&#x2019;s ready for the race track by the time it reaches its owner. Don&#x2019;t use cruise control. You want to vary your new engine&#x2019;s RPM as much as possible, so your engine gets used to different loads and conditions. If you are setting off on a lengthy road trip with your brand-new wheels, have plenty of coffee breaks or consciously drive at different speeds. Avoid short distance travel. Rather walk to the corner shop for a litre of milk. In the early stages of ownership, it&#x2019;s important for your new car&#x2019;s engine to reach operating temperature every time you drive somewhere. Don&#x2019;t tow that boat to the dam. Towing anything during the break-in period is harmful as it also causes engine strain.</li></li></li></li>
