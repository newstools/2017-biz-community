Rupert Stadler and Oliver Blume, the board of management chairmen of Audi AG and Porsche AG, plan to cooperate even more closely. Through the effective application of development capacities, additional scope is to be created for the topics of electrification, digitisation and autonomous driving. This will reportedly enhance competitiveness so that the two companies can optimally utilise the opportunities for future model generations and better meet the challenges. The focus is on the joint development of shared vehicle architectures, modules and components. Collaboration within the Volkswagen Group is nothing new. Audi, VW and Porsche have worked together successfully for many years in the area of SUVs, and with the new development cooperation, Porsche and Audi are positioning themselves for the next decade. Taking advantage of synergies &#x201c;Together, we will make faster progress in the race for the mobility of the future. We will utilise the expertise of both companies and take advantage of synergies,&#x201d; said Blume. &#x201c;We will cooperate wherever it makes sense, but we will also be very careful to maintain the differentiation between our brands. A Porsche is always a Porsche, and that will remain so in the future.&#x201d; In the coming months, joint teams will prepare the specific areas of cooperation and define the roadmap as far as 2025. Project work will take place in various areas, each of which will be jointly headed by a representative of each brand.
