Dave Tiltmann, managing director of Algoa FM, said, "Being judged to be the best in South Africa for creating compelling campaigns is a massive honour for our business, and I am delighted with my staff.&#x201d; &#x201c;Once again, we have proven that whether it be for our clients or ourselves, Algoa FM is the best when it comes to solution-driven creatives!" Algoa FM designed the campaign to launch the app that allows its audience to engage with the station on relevant issues. The campaign resulted in a 1000% increase in downloads. However, it was the way in which the campaign enticed listeners and social media followers to take action that impressed the judges. Operations director, Alfie Jay, said: "I am so proud of my team right now.&#x201d; &#x201c;From my digital and graphic design staff who designed the app, to my creative team who conceptualised the campaign, my on-air team for their flawless execution, and my awards team for their hard work and dedication.&#x201d; &#x201c;This is a great result for our radio station and Algoa Country as a whole." The Liberty Radio Awards Ceremony, which acknowledges the best of the best in the South African radio industry, was hosted at the Sandton Convention Centre, in Johannesburg.
