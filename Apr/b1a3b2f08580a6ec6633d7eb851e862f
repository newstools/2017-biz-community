The event, held at Rise Cape Town in Woodstock, brought together investors, tech and startup gurus, and mentors who will give input and help take the 10 selected companies to the next level. Yossi Hasson, MD of Techstars welcomed new mentors taking part in the programme, and welcomed back some of last year's mentors for the second programme while reiterating how valuable mentorship is in the startup scene. Rise Cape Town Rise is a fintech innovation hub that brings together a global community of startups and experts to solve some of Barclays&#x2019; biggest business challenges, under the motto &#x2018;connect, co-create, scale&#x2019;. The hubs deliver multiple programmes for open innovation, including the Barclays Accelerator programme, powered by Techstars. Barclays Africa launches third accelerator programmeBarclays Africa has launched Rise, a global start-up community pioneering financial services and unlocking Africa's potential.

Excited to be back at @ThinkRiseAfrica! Tonight we're finding out who the top 10 participants for the Barclays Accelerator 2017 is! pic.twitter.com/gLoF3Vyodl&#x2014; Bizcommunity IT (@Biz_IT) April 20, 2017 The successful participants, all focussed on providing fintech solutions in Africa, will partake in a 13-week growth acceleration programme at the Rise hub, kicking off on 9 May 2017. The aim is to achive two years' progress over a period of three months. The companies will follow the proven Techstars model and they will have direct access to top mentors, investors and venture capitalists in Africa as well life-long access to the Techstars global network. The Accelerator programme aims to uncover the next &#x2018;Paypal&#x2019; by working with exceptional fintech entrepreneurs innovating Africa&#x2019;s financial services industry. Applications were received from fintech startups in 52 countries. &#x201c;Each of the ten successful companies represented something unique that we believe has the potential to become a significant and relevant player on a global scale,&#x201d; says Hasson. &#x201c;Access to Barclays Africa&#x2019;s base is a significant opportunity for these fintech companies to greatly accelerate their growth through partnership or distribution deals with Barclays and access to their senior executives as mentors, providing key expertise to the startups that ordinarily would be almost impossible to get access to.&#x201d; 2017 programme participants The 2017 programme participants are: Flexpay (Kenya): Provides an automated and secured layaway system that manages the purchase of goods.
