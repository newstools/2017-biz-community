Borrowing the tone of a tech crowdfunding campaign, the satirical film pitches the &#x2018;Personal Embarrassment Guard&#x2019; (PEG) as a &#x2018;new wearable&#x2019; that blocks the &#x2018;awkward&#x2019; stench of war crimes. Flaunting PEG&#x2019;s &#x2018;nasal technology&#x2019;, the satirical product film rolls into a montage of the content faces of PEG-wearing diplomats, complete with upbeat, inspirational music, before abruptly cutting to real-life footage of the conflict in Syria. Targeting the Brussels Conference on supporting the future of Syria and the Region on 5 April, the campaign film was distributed to journalists covering the talks and be supported by a stunt in Brussels. Developed in-house by the independent advocacy organisation, the PEG campaign acts as a creative way of explaining the complicated diplomatic situation currently concerning Syria. London-based production company, Armoury, brought the concept to life and was responsible for directing and casting the film, and creatively directing the animation. Director Jack Laurance of Armoury comments: &#x201c;The project was immediately appealing to us for the level of creativity and humour being levelled at such a serious subject. Recreating the world of the PEG product and its well-trodden visual cues was a great exercise. These sorts of projects allow us to focus on a moral imperative, as opposed to a commercial one. However, approaching it creatively was the key and one that James Turner at The Syria Campaign led from the beginning. They were fantastic to work with.&#x201d; James Turner, communications director for the Syria Campaign, comments, "Armoury immediately understood what we were trying to do with the PEG concept and the collaboration was effortless. Jack and the team brought it to life so cleverly, and with such craft, that it felt like the idea had been two years in the making. The fact that it only took two weeks is almost making me pinch myself or perhaps peg myself. For more information, go to nosepeg.com.
