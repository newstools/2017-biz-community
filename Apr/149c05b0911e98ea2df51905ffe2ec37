The conference will be held again this year in order to further develop these connections and make headway to bring kiwifruit into SA. According to Panagiotis Dermetzoglou from the economic and commercial affairs office at the Greek embassy in Pretoria, &#x201c;The fruit growing seasons in the two countries complement each other and create mutual benefits for them. He emphasised that Greece is implementing a roadmap for stabilising the national economy for sustainable growth, which makes it an ideal trading partner.&#x201d; &#x201c;In a world where we all face a wide range of challenges, we definitely need to improve the overall conditions for our two countries to engage and increased trade is, of course, an important element of this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Kiwifruit provides high levels of fibre, anti-oxidants, and phytonutrients. They are extremely high in vitamin C - which is a powerful anti-oxidant,&#x201d; said Clinical Nutritionist Nicci Robertson.
