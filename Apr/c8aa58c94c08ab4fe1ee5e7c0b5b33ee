An Honiball, GM of Ads24 is particularly proud of its digital storytelling combined with the innovative use of technology. "It creates so many new opportunities for advertisers," she adds, and "is undoubtedly a recipe for success". Here, Honiball talks us through each win and what this means for advertisers. Netwerk24 won a Gold Award for 'craft, news or feature writing' &#x2013; Die stil aktivis Netwerk24 won a Gold Award in the &#x2018;craft, news or feature writing&#x2019; category for 'Die stil aktivis' (The silent activist) by Le Roux Schoeman. &#x201c;This is a massive achievement for both Netwerk24 and NetNuus. Netwerk24 and NetNuus were the only Afrikaans entries that were awarded. The Gold Award especially shows that we remain committed to journalism,&#x201d; says Honiball, and produce quality Afrikaans content, she adds. NetNuus won a Silver Award for 'publisher app' &#x2013; Yellow brick road to success NetNuus is all about blurbs, headlines and skimming the news when you&#x2019;re really pressed for time. It&#x2019;s a free, in-app experience with a bit of a wider content focus than Netwerk24. Also, it&#x2019;s the only app of its kind in South Africa. It provides snackable news and an opportunity for its audience to stay informed and to engage with the content. Netwerk24 won a Silver Award for 'publisher site' &#x2013; Lessons behind a paywall Netwerk24 has had a hard paywall since July 2016 and so far it has been a great success with readers willing to pay for this premium Afrikaans content. &#x201c;The paywall might restrict access, but it gives our loyal and potential advertisers the sweet assurance that they&#x2019;re reaching a very loyal and committed audience with a high disposable income. Our readers have deliberately made the choice to purchase our high-quality and award-winning content online. Furthermore, advertisers are always impressed when they learn just how engaged our audience is with our content. The engagement levels really are something special.&#x201d; Soccer Laduma won a Silver Award for 'specialist publisher site' Soccer Laduma is a mass market title with an effective reach of approximately 5.9 million people. Digitally it reaches about 1.5 million people (combined UBs). It provides breaking news, interviews and analysis on local and international football complemented by user-generated content constantly feeding off each other to create a 24-hour hub of interaction. &#x201c;This is proof that Soccer Laduma is the biggest active football community in South Africa across its print, web, mobile and social media properties." Daily Sun won a Bronze Award for 'social media publications' &#x2013; Tshwane on fire The Daily Sun is called 'the people&#x2019;s paper' for a reason. The newspaper proudly tells the stories of the people of Mzansi, as they are. While the printed paper remains strong, but there is also huge engagement and a significant following on its social media sites, effectively reaching 5.4 million people in total.
