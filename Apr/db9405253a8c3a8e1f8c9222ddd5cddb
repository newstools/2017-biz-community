&#x201c;We are unleashing everyone&#x2019;s inner hero,&#x201d; says national event coordinator, Trevor Latimer. &#x201c;Participants are encouraged to use The Color Run as a platform for good. Whether it&#x2019;s raising awareness for a good cause or raising funds for charity or even simply acknowledging that you live with Supermom - this year we celebrate the superhero in us all.&#x201d; Capitec Bank once again joins The Color Run as the headline sponsor on the South African leg. &#x201c;The Superhero Tour has inspired thousands to believe in themselves, embrace a healthy lifestyle, and support their communities by coming together,&#x201d; says Francois Viviers, exec marketing and communications at Capitec Bank. &#x201c;We are encouraged by being a part of this movement which is shaping not only the way we take responsibility for our own lives, but how we engage with and support communities.&#x201d; Two rules Worldwide, The Color Run has created a following that cares less about a 10-minute-mile and more about having the time of their lives &#x2013; and for the first time, Benoni will experience what it means to be a Color Runner. With only two rules, the idea is easy to follow: 1. Wear white at the starting line. 2. Finish plastered in colour. After Color Runners complete the race, the fun continues with the Finish Festival. The party is equipped with music, dancing and massive colour throws, which create millions of vivid colour combinations. For more info, go to www.thecolorrun.co.za to find out more.
