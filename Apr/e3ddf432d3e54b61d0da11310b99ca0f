Four reasons print marketing still matters Don&#x2019;t ever listen to anyone who tries to talk you out of print marketing. While it&#x2019;s impossible to deny the enormous value digital marketing provides &#x2013; and you need to be investing a large portion of your marketing and advertising budget in digital &#x2013; it&#x2019;s equally difficult to overlook the value of print. Here are a few reasons why: 1. Cost-effectiveness Return on investment will always be a key metric when evaluating marketing spend. And when compared to some areas of digital marketing, print is simply more cost effective. Consider printed brochures that you would distribute at a live event or conference, for example. When you order in the right quantities, print brochures can be really affordable (usually costing just pennies a piece). When you realise that the average cost per click (CPC) for many online advertisements is more than a dollar, you see just how cost-effective it is. 2. Wide reach The vast, vast majority of consumers are online in one capacity or another. Even most grandparents are familiar with how to use the internet. But you have to remember that not all people are internet active. Furthermore, there are millions of people who still conduct 100 percent of their shopping in brick and mortar stores. &#x201c;Yeah I know it&#x2019;s kind of crazy to think about it nowadays, but it is very true,&#x201d; marketer Sabline Carbaugh says. &#x201c;There are people that couldn&#x2019;t care less about using the internet and those people should not be forgotten. If these people are completely disregarded just for the sake that online advertising is easier, then business could miss out on many potential customers.&#x201d; 3. Sensory engagement Perhaps the greatest benefit print marketing has over digital is its tangibility. Customers can touch and feel paper between their fingers. Different types of paper have unique weight, coarseness, and smells. There&#x2019;s just something about touching a marketing material that makes it seem more alive to the customer. 4. Legitimate You can&#x2019;t believe everything you read on the internet! As the idea of fake news has gotten more press over the past year, customers have become more skeptical of the digital marketing elements they encounter. They&#x2019;re less likely to fall for sensational marketing and even approach genuine advertisements with a healthy sense of suspicion. One of the many benefits of print is that it&#x2019;s widely viewed as credible. When customers go to pick up a newspaper or mainstream magazine publication, they&#x2019;re much more trusting of the content inside. Much of this is simply the result of perception, but it&#x2019;s the way things are. If you want to further legitimise your brand, it would be wise to take a closer look at print marketing and how it can be used to your advantage. Blend print and digital for best results While you may hear rumors that digital marketing has rendered print useless, it simply isn&#x2019;t true. As this article proves, print still offers immense value to those who are willing to invest in it. At the end of the day, print and digital should work together. In order to achieve the best results, you&#x2019;ll need to invest in both mediums. This will allow you to reach the most people and enjoy the best results.
