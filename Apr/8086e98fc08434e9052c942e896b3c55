Sergey Nivens 123RF.comOBG CEO, Andrew Jeffreys, said that the partnership with Thomson Reuters represented another milestone for the Group, further extending its reach at a time when interest in emerging economies had never been higher. &#x201c;We know that while investors are keen to find out about the opportunities and openings that these markets offer, information vacuums and a lack of reliable data can be a challenge. Our partnership will help to raise the profile of the 35-plus economies that we analyse, all of which have a growth story to tell.&#x201d; Marc-Andr de Blois, OBG&#x2019;s director of communications, said he was delighted that Eikon&#x2019;s 150,000-plus subscribers would now have access to the group&#x2019;s content. &#x201c;Investors inevitably want to learn more about how they can participate in the development taking place across the high-growth markets that our group covers, many of which are outperforming both advanced economies and BRIC countries. We look forward to sharing our findings with a wider audience through this prestigious and effective financial channel.&#x201d;
