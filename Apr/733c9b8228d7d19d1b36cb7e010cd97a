Pick n Pay's Super Animals&#x201c;The first Super Animals campaign was so successful that we were forced to print additional collector&#x2019;s albums when we ran out of them during last year&#x2019;s campaign. We are delighted that we could persuade the creators of Super Animals to bring out a special South African version just for our customers. These animal cards are a way to learn more about South Africa&#x2019;s wildlife, while having fun at the same time,&#x201d; said Andrew Pretorius, Pick n Pay Marketing. There are 108 cards to collect and swap, all categorised into the major biomes in South Africa: Wetlands, Ocean, Savanna, Fynbos, Coast, Nama Karoo, Thicket, Succulent, Karoo, and Forest. Collectors are encouraged to place them in the correct slot in the special edition Collector&#x2019;s Album and learn more about the animals that inhabit these biomes. The facts of each animal have also been arranged on the card in such a way that kids can enjoy competing against each other in a fun game comparing facts. R1 from every album sale will go to SANParks The Collector&#x2019;s Album, filled with trivia and educational activities, will sell at Pick n Pay for R20, with R1 from every album sale going to SANParks. &#x201c;We have a relationship with SANParks through our &#x2018;Kids in Parks&#x2019; programme, which takes 5,000 children from underprivileged areas into South Africa&#x2019;s national parks every year. This makes a difference to each child who visits one of South Africa&#x2019;s famous parks. These visits encourage an awareness of the value of protecting our parks as tourist destinations which can generate money for local communities,&#x201d; said Pretorius. In addition, each South African Super Animals card has a barcode that can be read by a Sound Card Reader (available at Pick n Pay for R60). When swiped through this device, the sound of the animal depicted &#x2013; whether roar or ribbet &#x2013; is brought to life. Collectors can also take the sensory experience to another level by downloading the free Pick n Pay South African Super Animals app. Available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and featuring Augmented Reality (AR) functions, the app blends AR and ordinary videography technology seamlessly into reality.
