 Jakub Jirsak 123RF.comCommunications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo on Wednesday said the Broadcasting Act clearly makes provision for the President to appoint the interim board within 10 days of receiving recommendations from the National Assembly. The National Assembly made recommendations of five names to constitute the SABC interim board. The President thereafter appointed all the five nominated people to constitute the interim board for a period of six months and as such, they &#x201c;enjoy the confidence of the shareholder&#x201d;. &#x201c;As government, we would like to assure the public that the current interim board is a legally constituted board. The board has been mandated to implement the SABC Ad hoc Committee recommendations and should be afforded the space to do its work. &#x201c;It is expected that the interim board should ensure proper functionality of the South African Broadcasting Cooperation, so as to deliver on its public mandate, as per the Broadcasting Act. &#x201c;We reassert our full confidence in the capability of the current interim board to execute its mandate,&#x201d; said Minister Dlodlo. She called on all role players to allow the board and its authority to execute its duties.
