Diplo has crafted an impressive career as a musician/DJ/producer. The Grammy-winning producer has proven himself to be a ubiquitous cultural figure, consistently bridging high and low, mainstream and underground, with remarkable tact and reverence. 2016 saw Major Lazer&#x2019;s &#x201c;Cold Water&#x201d; featuring Justin Bieber and M debut at #1 on the iTunes songs chart in 58 countries worldwide and reach #1 on the US pop radio chart. The song continues to top charts worldwide, with more than 861-million streams to date. Diplo also contributed two songs, &#x201c;Hold Up&#x201d; and &#x201c;All Night,&#x201d; to Beyonc &#x2019;s #1 album Lemonade and received three Grammy nominations in 2016 for Producer of the Year, Best Dance Recording (for Where Are Now with Skrillex and Justin Bieber), and Best Dance/Electronic Album (for Skrillex And Diplo Present Jack ).
