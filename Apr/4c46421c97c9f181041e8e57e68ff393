While international research emphasises the importance of creating engaging work spaces, many corporates have yet to embrace this. We want to reward those that have and encourage those that have not, to follow suit.&#x201d; Improved efficiencies and productivity Williams points to research out of Harvard University, "We know productivity can be compromised by poor air quality, low light and constant noise distractions. These are the conversations we want people to have." The concept for the competition was first launched by JLL Netherlands in 2013 and will be presented for the first time in South Africa in July 2017. Contenders should put forward workplaces that facilitate a good work-life balance with emphasis on improved efficiencies and productivity.
