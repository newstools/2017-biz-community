Engineers at Hyundai Motor Europe's Technical Center conducted the winter test on the edge of the Arctic Circle, focusing on the i30 N's performance and handling characteristics, adjusting the set-up to ensure it will be a performance vehicle for everyone. The team worked with Neuville to develop and tune the i30 N's dynamic systems, and to test the Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Limited Slip Differential (LSD), as well as the steering, dampers, suspension and tyres. The i30 N will launch in the second half of 2017 and will be the third member of the i30 family.
