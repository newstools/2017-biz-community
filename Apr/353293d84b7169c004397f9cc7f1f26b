The South African Rugby Union is due to make a ruling on 6 April 2017 as to whether the Toyota Cheetahs will be allowed to participate in the southern hemisphere&#x2019;s premier rugby competition, the Vodacom Super Rugby tournament. This after SANZAR, the rugby authority in charge of Super Rugby, announced its intention to reduce participating teams from 18 to 15. This will see South Africa possibly lose two teams, with the Port Elizabeth-based Southern Kings and the Bloemfontein-based Toyota Cheetahs most likely to get chopped. Says OFM General Manager Nick Efstathiou: &#x201c;The Free State has long been known as a breeding ground for future Springboks. Therefore it is almost unthinkable that the team might be kicked out of the tournament. SANZAR&#x2019;s decision has put immense pressure on the team and a spate of injuries to key players has resulted in only two wins in their five games to date. It&#x2019;s time Cheetah supporters rally around the team and do all they can to support our boys in orange. We urge our listeners to sign our online petition to keep the Toyota Cheetahs in Super Rugby!&#x201d; In addition, Efstathiou says lack of support at games could also be a determining factor in SANZAR&#x2019;s final decision. He says fans should show up at games in droves, wearing orange to show their support. &#x201c;OFM is the number one supporter of the Toyota Cheetahs and as a station we will do all we can to make sure the Toyota Cheetahs does not become an endangered species on the Super Rugby franchise list!&#x201d; says Efstathiou.
