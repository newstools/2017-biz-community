 eevl 123RF.comOmotoso, a Nigerian national, is the leader of the Jesus Dominion International in Durban. The evangelist came under scrutiny after his church featured on current affairs programme, Special Assignment, on Sunday. The programme featured over 30 young women, from all over the country, who claimed that they were lured into performing sexual favours for the pastor at his Durban home. The Hawks pounced on the pastor at the Port Elizabeth International Airport upon his arrival from KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday, 20 April 2017. The officials were given false information about his flight details. Members of the Hawks arrested him in a toilet cubicle at the airport, where it is believed he was seeking refuge. The Portfolio Committee on Police has commended Omotoso&#x2019;s swift arrest. &#x201c;The speed with which the police and Hawks moved in apprehending the alleged perpetrator of these serious crimes is commendable. We hope this will send out a strong message that the country does not take kindly to any form of crime,&#x201d; said Committee Chairperson, Francois Beukman.
