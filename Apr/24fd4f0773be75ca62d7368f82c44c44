A whole family event, children will be entertained with various kids' activities such as face painting and sand art, as well as the permanent purpose-built kiddie heaven play area. Entrance is free. For those who want to explore the wine stalls, a R150 tasting passport (which includes a wine glass) can be purchased on www.quicket.co.za For 2017's Noordhoek Crush, the organisers have made a few changes: Pre-sold tasting passports will be available: Last year many travelled from far only to find that the tickets for wine tasting were sold out. There are only 750 tickets available and it is advisable to buy these beforehand. Food stalls and a dedicated food and chill area: All the Noordhoek Farm Village restaurants wll be open for business as usual, as well as providing pop-up stalls within the festival area. More parking available: Along with parking at The Noordhoek Village, a field has been made available.</li></li> Corkage fees waived An off-consumption liquor license is in place so wine can be bought at cellar door prices to consume on or off the premises. The Village Restaurants will be waiving their corkage fees to promote the purchasing and consuming of the wines on the day. There will be a live band providing music throughout the festival.
