The chamber is said to be the first of its kind in the country and offers manufacturers the option of sending their refrigerated vehicles for a thermal rating certified by the SABS. Managing director of Serco, Clinton Holcroft, said the establishment of the chamber was good news for the marketplace. &#x201c;We will definitely send our units there for testing and make our ratings available for customers. &#x201c;Official thermal ratings have been a mandatory requirement in the industry in Europe for a long time and are something long overdue in our country where the thermal capacity of refrigerated vehicles has not been certified before by a highly respected body such as the SABS,&#x201d; said Holcroft.
