&#x201c;It is our ambition to reach 100,000 learners by 2020. While we have experienced exponential growth over the past few years, we realised that our existing positioning was limiting our potential,&#x201d; says Stefan Botha, chief executive officer of Impaq. &#x201c;However, selecting a new name was not an easy task. We wanted to honour our history while also positioning ourselves for the future.&#x201d; The company, which was established as a home education provider servicing 400 learners in 2002, last year supplied learning material and support services to 13,000 learners across the home education, tutor and schools market. It expects to reach more than 17,000 learners in 2017. &#x201c;Over the past few years, we have invested heavily in the development and improvement of all elements of our offering. As we enter into this new chapter, our continued focus is to grow our position as a market leader through continued improvement and the commitment to better serve all our customers &#x2013; learners, parents, tutors and schools. Although our name has changed, we remain dedicated to quality and to ensuring a first-class educational experience,&#x201d; concludes Botha. To learn more, visit www.impaq.co.za.
