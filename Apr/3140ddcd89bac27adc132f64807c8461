The development of much-needed skills for the financial services sector in South Africa has been given a boost by a collaborative donation of R10m over five years from Nedbank and Old Mutual to the African Institute of Financial Markets and Risk Management (AIFMRM) in the Faculty of Commerce at the University of Cape Town (UCT). The university is delighted with the endowment and notes that a significant number of the major banks and insurance companies in South Africa have now invested in the institute. In a further show of support, the Banking Sector Education and Training Authority (BANKSETA) contributed over R5.25m in bursary funding for AIFMRM in 2017, says AIFMRM director Professor David Taylor. Job-ready graduates &#x201c;These are significant contributions and a vote of faith in what we are doing at the institute,&#x201d; says Taylor. &#x201c;The Nedbank and Old Mutual investment will help us to expand our operations, and to produce more graduates, who are able to contribute to the sector. &#x201c;The truth is that the breadth of knowledge and abilities required to be truly effective at this level in the financial sector is beyond an undergraduate education,&#x201d; says Taylor. &#x201c;It was this realisation that prompted the industry to collaborate with UCT to establish an institute that focuses on specialised postgraduate financial services education and emphasises producing job-ready graduates. At present, AIFMRM offers two Master&#x2019;s degrees in collaboration with the School of Management Studies in the Faculty of Commerce at UCT. The MCom in Risk Management of Financial Markets and the MPhil specialising in Mathematical Finance are rigorous academic programmes with a strong practical and industry-related focus. The latter degree is ranked in the Top 50 Financial Markets Master&#x2019;s Programmes in the world by ranking agency, Eduniversal. Apprenticeship ethos &#x201c;We carefully designed these programmes in collaboration with industry to ensure we are meeting their needs,&#x201d; says Taylor. There is an &#x201c;apprenticeship ethos&#x201d; in both programmes that is geared towards preparing students for the workplace by simulating experiences that they are likely to encounter. They are also equipped with a host of &#x201c;soft skills&#x201d; to prepare them for success. &#x201c;We expect them to be professional from day one. They learn to be aware of the impression they give. How they dress and talk to people matters.&#x201d; Most South African students enrolled on AIFMRM postgraduate programmes receive bursaries or scholarships and a strong transformation agenda underpins the selection and promotion of graduates on the programmes. At present, the majority of students are black, coloured or Indian South Africans. &#x201c;The uptake is pretty rapid. From last year&#x2019;s cohort, everyone who wanted a job gained employment. We will continue to improve and expand in line with the Institute&#x2019;s vision to increase the extent and depth of the financial service expertise on the continent," says Taylor.
