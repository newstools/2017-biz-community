Deloitte's new Gauteng officesDeloitte&#x2019;s new premises will be developed in Waterfall in Midrand. The total estimated development cost is in excess of R1bn. Mike Jarvis, chief operating officer of Deloitte Africa, says: &#x201c;The consolidation of our Johannesburg and Pretoria offices into one Gauteng office in Waterfall City promises to be an exciting journey. We are quickly outgrowing both existing office spaces and are now in a position to bring together approximately 3,700 of our people into one, new, custom-designed building in what is clearly an attractive corporate destination. Deloitte is constantly looking for ways in which our people can make a meaningful impact to our clients, talent and communities. This move will help us do exactly that by gearing our operations to attract the best talent and serve our expanding market.&#x201d; Silver LEED Green Rating The premises will comprise 42,500m2 of quality workspace, which will consolidate Deloitte&#x2019;s current Woodmead and Pretoria offices in a single central location.
