 Sergii Gnatiuk 123RF.comAnswering questions posed by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, Raymond Zondo told the Judicial Service Commission in Johannesburg that after he matriculated he approached a shop owner, known as Moosa, to ask for a loan to ensure his mother could eat while he went to university to study law. Moosa agreed and every month his mother was allowed to collect groceries worth R20 from his shop. When Zondo completed his degree, he returned to pay the loan. "But [Moosa] said: 'Don't worry, just do to others what I have done to you'," said Zondo, reaching for a handkerchief to wipe his eyes. Zondo, 56, who was nominated by President Jacob Zuma, told the JSC that if he succeeded Dikgang Moseneke he would remain humble. "If I am appointed, I will remember, as I have throughout my career, that I come from communities that are very poor. "Just because I became a lawyer, a judge, judge president or justice of the Constitutional Court, it doesn't mean I am no longer part of those people," said Zondo. He said he would open a debate about changing the way trials were conducted if he got the job and proposed that matters be brought before the courts by way of affidavits. "Affidavits would force that everyone disclose [what they have] beforehand," he said.
