&#x201c;Malls have become integral to our society. It is where consumers shop, eat, socialise, bank and are entertained. And because of this, the environment is ideal for brands wanting to effectively engage with consumers,&#x201d; says John Faia, General Manager: Mall Ads&#x2122;. Faia has a long history of experience within the mall environment and with an in-depth understanding of all aspects of marketing including strategy, creative and execution, he brings versatility and agility to Provantage Media Group&#x2019;s Mall Ads&#x2122;. The mall industry in South Africa and on the rest of the continent is exploding, in line with the growth in population, mass urbanisation and trends in consumer purchasing power. The mall culture in South Africa, and its ability to sustain an increasingly diverse and economically viable consumer profile, is evident in mall refurbishments, extensions and the development of new mega-malls.
