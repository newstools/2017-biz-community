 Jakub Gojda via 123RFSince the inception of the festival in 2006, Africa in Motion has collated submissions and information on films, now presented in this database, which is one of the most extensive online collections of African films. The database provides user-friendly search functions - searches can be undertaken by title, country, language, director, year, genre of theme, for example, Nollywood, Bongo films, animations, comedy, youth films, and so on. Where available, film entries include contact information, thus enabling researchers, cinema programmers, festival curators and others to contact filmmakers or distributors to request access to a specific title. Festival producer, Justine Atkinson commented: &#x201c;Due to the difficulty in finding African films, we regularly receive requests from academics, industry professionals and curators for details of films and information on films from a specific director, genre or time period. We therefore decided to collate the information we had and develop our own custom built website to ensure that finding African films is as accessible as possible.&#x201d; This public archive of African cinema is providing an invaluable resource as a centralised place to search for and locate African films.
