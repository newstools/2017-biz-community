Johannesburg Design Week 2017 is an initiative that aims to put South African design on the map, while making great design accessible to people from all walks of life. Trend forecaster and business consultant Dave Nemeth from Trend Forward, who conceptualised the initiative, says Johannesburg Design Week seeks to demystify design. &#x201c;Other design events around the country always target the same niched, elitist audience. Johannesburg Design Week aims to take design to a wider audience, making good design, as well as a better understanding of design, accessible to all,&#x201d; says Nemeth. This explains the decision to use the Rand Show 2017 as a platform to launch Johannesburg Design Week to over 200,000 people from a broad cross-section of society. &#x2018;Best of the Best' design display For the duration of the Rand Show, from 14 to 23 April 2017, Johannesburg Design Week will present an extensive curated display of the best in d cor, furniture, lighting, jewellery and fashion design in the Rand Show&#x2019;s new Design Pavilion. This display &#x2013; &#x201c;Best of the Best of SA Design 2017&#x201d; &#x2013; will showcase inspiring local design chosen by a panel of design authorities. Project 81 Another display presented in the Rand Show&#x2019;s Design Pavilion is the intriguingly named Project81. This initiative of design education group Inscape, in partnership with Belgotex Floors, challenges Inscape design students to create products out of waste Belgotex carpeting. Each year, 81 products are selected nationally to be showcased at events such as the Rand Show, where students can be exposed to potential investors who could help them turn their prototypes into viable products. Design talks for show visitors Inscape and other leading experts are putting together a programme of public workshops and talks that will cover topics such as choosing design as a career, understanding the importance of design, and learning more about the &#x201c;maker movement&#x201d; and how it can benefit the youth. Designing a better business Johannesburg Design Week will feature a series of conferences, workshops and master classes given by leading names in the business world, and aimed at business people from management level, and entrepreneurs. &#x201c;The beauty of aligning with the Rand Show is that a large percentage of professionals are on leave over the Easter period, making it easier for them to attend a master class or short workshop whilst still being in an environment that is exciting and engaging for the rest of the family,&#x201d; says Nemeth. Highlights of this business-oriented programme include: Entrepreneurial evangelist, and producer and presenter of Hot 91.9&#x2019;s HOT Entrepreneurs show, Lisa Illingworth, presents two workshops in the MAN Building on Tuesday, 18 April: &#x201c;Thinking Like an Entrepreneur&#x201d;, from 9am to 10:30am, R150 per ticket. There are five key behavioural traits that sustain entrepreneurs when market conditions are tough or when they need to change direction. Come and learn about rewiring the way you think so that no matter what idea you have or how business is going, your mindset is programmed with the fundamental processes that will make you future-proof. &#x201c;Business Model Canvassing&#x201d;, from 1pm to 2:45pm, R150 per ticket. Planning and starting a business doesn&#x2019;t have to mean planning for every eventuality from the start. In this workshop, you&#x2019;ll learn how to use the business model canvassing tool to understand the basics and get those right, whilst getting to market as quickly as possible, rather than relying on projections that are, at best, an educated guess. Futuresplash, on Friday, 21 April in the MAN Building, from 9am to 10:30am, R150 per ticket. Trend forecaster and business consultant Dave Nemeth will present his 2018/2019 trend report.
