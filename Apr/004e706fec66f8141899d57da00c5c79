Fleet manager at Bakers Transport, Mohammed Cassim, said they were awaiting delivery of the units which would go into operation almost immediately. For Serco, it was about servicing the customer by coming up with an innovative idea to reduce the downtime of vehicles and also to speed up turnaround times. According to Cassim, the units would be ideal for the quick loading and offloading needed around the Clicks Distribution Centre. &#x201c;We have been doing business with Serco for the past 10 years and can vouch for its high-quality products and services,&#x201d; he said. A "relatively new concept" Serco managing director Clinton Holcroft said the demountable load bodies, complete with load securing straps, were a relatively new concept on the market. He describes it as a container concept on wheels. &#x201c;The idea is that the body and the sub-structure can be dropped off at the distribution centre while the chassis is taken away to be reloaded. The turnaround time is much faster,&#x201d; said Holcroft. &#x201c;Part of the challenge was to get the tail lift to operate from the truck chassis instead of from the body as was generally done. This reduces the number of tail lifts required, as well as the financial outlay by the customer, saving money and giving our client the edge,&#x201d; concluded Holcroft.
