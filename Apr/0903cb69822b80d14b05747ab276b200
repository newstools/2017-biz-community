Forest Loop openingThe iSimangaliso Wetland Park now boasts five ecologically distinct visitor drive game drives: Pan Loop, Vlei Loop, Dune Loop, Grassland Loop and Forest Loop. Each has its own distinctive attractions en route including hides, lookout points, picnic sites, places of interest &#x2013; like Lake Bhangazi &#x2013; and vistas. &#x201c;The brief to MBB Consulting Engineers was for an ecologically optimal design that works with nature and allows access for all into the park &#x2013; no matter the type of vehicle. With earth coloured concrete strips and grass blocks to optimise the feeling of being in nature, I think we have achieved that,&#x201d; says Andrew Zaloumis, iSimangaliso CEO. &#x201c;iSimangaliso inherited 35km of poor gravel roads from St Lucia to Cape Vidal and Mission Rocks beach. At times these were only suitable for 4x4s. Our aim has been to give all South Africans access and a full experience of what is on offer. Today, the Eastern Shores has 66km of high-quality roads that are environmentally appropriate, with a new range of visitor facilities including hides, lookout points and picnic sites that are wheelchair friendly.&#x201d;
