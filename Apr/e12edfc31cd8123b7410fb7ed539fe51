&#x201c;We are excited to be launching a first for Blok that responds to needs that are current and very real in today's market - the lack of diversified urban housing in well located areas. As developers, we recognise that we have a role to play in contributing towards a more integrated, diversified and sustainable development trajectory. By using a research-by-design development approach borne out of partnerships between us as developers, the city and the community, we have utilised well located land and are wanting to unlock bulk potential on existing sites approved for development. The aim is to provide urban apartments that serve the currently uncatered-for middle income market that will be incorporated within our planned development. Our goal with this project is to evolve a model that can be used to illustrate the role of developers in the development of the city and create awareness around their ability to undertake similar projects that will begin to assist in contributing well located urban housing targeted at the middle income market,&#x201d; explains Blok&#x2019;s MD and co-founder Jacques van Embden. Community collaboration The site for the proposed development is currently a vacant piece of land in the Bo-Kaap. The development's design aims to sensitively acknowledge and incorporate the neighbourhood's built cultural heritage and urban fabric whilst trying to nudge the architecture in a modern way. In addition, Blok hopes to collaborate with the community on certain elements in and around the development. &#x201c;We are excited to share the details of the development concept and new product over the coming weeks. The new development reflects our passion for urbanism, our ethos of being involved in the communities in which we develop and our interest in pushing the boundaries of design,&#x201d; concludes van Embden.
