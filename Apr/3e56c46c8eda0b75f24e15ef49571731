Engen Hippo Park owner Ntandokazi KheswaEngen Hippo Park owner Ntandokazi Kheswa says she was first afforded the opportunity in 2011 and it has since taken six years to finally come to fruition. &#x201c;As a black women-owner I am delighted to have this opportunity and have dreamt about owing my own business for a long time. I have had extensive experience working in other industries and believe that I have the potential to add a lot of value,&#x201d; she says. Seelan Naidoo, Engen&#x2019;s general manager: retail, says the decision to build a new service station along Queen Nandi Drive was driven by the need to provide motorists with an accessible and safe thoroughfare off the busy N2.
