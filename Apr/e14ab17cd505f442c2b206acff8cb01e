With a mission to set a benchmark in the world of spirits, the World Spirits Award attracts entries from distillers across the globe who submit their products to be adjudicated by a strict &#x2018;jury&#x2019; of expert tasters. This year, a total of 95 participants and distilleries from 25 nations participated in the competition, with 400 spirits submitted for consideration. Spirits are rated according to the 100-point system, and &#x201c;simply the best in spirits&#x201d; receive top marks. Twelve years a charm KWV, with its portfolio of spirits which includes cognac, brandy and gin, was the only South African distilling company who collected enough awards to be included in the list of &#x2018;World Class Distillers&#x2019;. In addition to this recognition, KWV also received a Double Gold for its KWV 12-year-old brandy &#x2013; one of only 44 Double Golds awarded during the competition. The KWV 12-year-old is a signature KWV Brandy, which was scored 95,3/100 by the judges, and was one in a line-up of aged KWV brandies that successfully played into a noted trend at the World Spirits Awards: organisers reflected that &#x201c;in the 100% distillate category it is noticeable that many products already have quite a few years of maturity under their belts and can thus already present themselves at their best." KWV 12-year-old impressed with its &#x201c;brilliant style and aromatic and perfumed nose&#x2026; and delicate brandy character (with) aromatic grape, roasty notes, subtle rum ester, light toffee, sponge, nut and nougat chocolate, honey, peach, leather, coffee, plump and yeasty sweetness, balanced [by a] compact [and] long finish&#x201d;. Further to this Double Gold award, KWV also took home Gold for the KWV 20-year-old, KWV 15-year-old, KWV 10-year-old, Imoya Brandy, Heritage Cognac and its Cruxland Gin as well as Silver for its Laborie Alambic Brandy. &#x201c;These results are noteworthy as they acknowledge and award, not one, but three, of KWV&#x2019;s distilling sectors &#x2013; cognac, brandy and gin &#x2013; indicating that the spirits production team really are treating the products with the craftsmanship needed to achieve extraordinary new heights in these categories,&#x201d; says Anneke Mackenzie, global portfolio manager of spirits at KWV.
