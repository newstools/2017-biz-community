The core focus of &#x2018;Taking You Places&#x2019; is the fastjet customer, and the frequent or first-time flyer. Its purpose is to effectively deliver on the airline&#x2019;s mandate &#x2013; to make air travel more affordable and accessible for everyone &#x2013; while highlighting the airline&#x2019;s culture and route network. Driving brand affinity with existing and potential customers &#x201c;The new campaign encourages a more emotive approach in tandem with our value proposition. We expect this to drive brand affinity with existing and potential customers,&#x201d; says Nico Bezuidenhout, CEO at fastjet. &#x201c;fastjet makes it more affordable for traders to take their business to the next level, to connect people with loved ones, and to make dream holidays a reality.&#x201d; Gendel Strategic Marketing Group (Gendel), recently appointed as fastjet&#x2019;s creative agency, will execute the &#x2018;Taking You Places&#x2019; campaign. Gendel will also introduce fastjet&#x2019;s new tagline from 'Smart Travel' to an airline 'For Everyone', which reflects its market position as a low-cost airline for the network and communities that it serves. &#x201c;The campaign will enrich the innovative and ambitious spirit of the fastjet brand,&#x201d; says Samantha Jones, director at Gendel. &#x201c;Our extensive experience and successes within the travel, tourism and commercial aviation industry on the continent position us well to collaborate with fastjet and help grow the brand.&#x201d; Making an impact on African aviation fastjet&#x2019;s route network includes Tanzanian domestic routes from its Dar es Salaam base to Kilimanjaro, Mbeya, and Mwanza, and international routes from Tanzania to Lusaka in Zambia and Harare in Zimbabwe. It also flies domestically from Harare to Victoria Falls, and internationally from Harare to Johannesburg in South Africa. &#x201c;fastjet has positively impacted aviation on the African continent by making air travel more accessible and providing reliable, on-time and affordable flights. Since launching in November 2012, we have flown over 2.5 million passengers, many who were first-time flyers and may not have previously had access to affordable air travel,&#x201d; says Bezuidenhout.
