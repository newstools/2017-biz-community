 hxdbzxy via 123RFUnited Nations secretary-general Ant nio Guterres and the chairperson of the African Union, Moussa Faki Mahamat, have signed a new landmark framework to strengthen partnership between the two organisations on peace and security pillars; and better respond to the changing dimensions and evolving challenges of peace operations. &#x201c;We no longer have the traditional peacekeeping operations, where peacekeepers separate two countries or two groups within the same country that have signed an agreement, and a makeshift peace essentially prevails,&#x201d; Guterres told the press, alongside Mahamat, after signing the framework at UN Headquarters in New York. &#x201c;We are witnessing, in Africa, as around the world, changes [&#x2026;] that force us to have a strategic review of the way peace operations take place,&#x201d; he explained. The Joint UN-AU Framework for Enhancing Partnership on Peace and Security is expected to boost the coordination between the two organisations at all levels. It is also anticipated to strengthen cooperation on issues ranging from human rights and good governance, to sustainable and inclusive development. The new understanding will also help align the African Union&#x2019;s Agenda 2063 with the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to ensure that they are both a &#x201c;success story&#x201d; in the continent. Prior to the press briefing, Guterres and Mahamat jointly led the first Joint UN-AU Annual Conference where they discussed the complementarity between the 2030 Agenda and the AU&#x2019;s Agenda 2063; as well as the fight against terrorism and the financing of operations led by the AU. They also discussed situations in several countries, including Libya, Mali, the Central African Republic, and Somalia; and efforts to combat the activities of the Boko Haram terrorist group.
