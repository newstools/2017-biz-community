Former Eskom CEO, Brian MolefeEskom had raised its concerns that the draft Report on the Verification of Compliance with SCM legal Framework &#x2013; Appointment of Tegeta Exploration and Resources (Pty) LTD was made available to third parties without Eskom having the opportunity to respond to the allegations contained in the report. "It seems very convenient and coincidental that the report is leaked to the media a day before its comments are due to be issued to National Treasury which, in the eyes of the public, would now be irrelevant as perceptions would now be reality," an Eskom press release said. The utility said that they have been given until 21 April 2017 to provide comments on the report. Relationship between Eskom and Tegeta The report investigates the relationship between Eskom and Tegeta - a coal supply company with ties to the Gupta family, and that Eskom and, in particular, its chairman and former group chief executive misled or lied to parliament, noting that this allegation was not founded on the truth, as the contract between Eskom and Tegeta predated the appointment of Brian Molefe as CEO. Molefe resigned late last year under a cloud, following the release of the public protector&#x2019;s State of Capture report. It showed that Molefe and the eldest of the Gupta brothers, had made 58 telephone calls to one another between August 2015 and March 2016. "Eskom remains fully committed to continue to work constructively with National Treasury, as they have done since July 2015 being the inception date of the review in order to reach finality on this matter," the statement said.
