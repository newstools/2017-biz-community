In November 2016, Adstream acquired Dubsats' print media delivery service, Adsend. We are excited to announce that Adsend's new website domain has gone live in South Africa. A great deal of work has taken place over the past few weeks and months to prepare for this crucial moment, and today Adsend moves to its new home. The site will look and feel exactly the same - only the URL will be different. Adsend's new URL is www.adsend.com Existing and new users will need to register to receive their updated login details. Our expert Print Support Team is on hand to ensure a smooth transition. Expect additional improvements in the months ahead, designed to further increase efficiency, reduce costs and enhance user experience. We look forward to providing Adsend clients with the high-levels of service and expertise that Adstream customers are used to.
