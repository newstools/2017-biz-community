The teams from Look What You&#x2019;re Missing TV and Continental Tyres will be taking a group of 20 plus adventure and cruiser bikers through the Karoo, up the N1 and beyond, filming the adventure all the way. Pillions and/or Wags are welcome to join the tour on the back of your motorcycle or in a support vehicle. South African Airlines is on board to get you home as well as GS Africa for a one-way motorcycle rental if you don&#x2019;t have your own, or to freight your motorcycles from Johannesburg back to the Mother City so you don&#x2019;t need to do the trip twice. Requirements This motorcycling experience across the Karoo is available to adventure bikes and cruisers, a minimum of 650cc motorbikes of any type as long as they are in roadworthy condition. Safety is of the utmost importance and qualified guides, a tour medic, and a support vehicle is included. The cost of the tour includes South Africa Bike Festival standard tickets for Friday, 26 May 2017. Circuit Test Rides are available at additional cost for each tour participant but are highly recommended and offer a great opportunity to test ride new models on the all-new Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit. The BMW Motorrad Off-road Skills Course will be in action all weekend, where visitors can test the new models around a short course, free of charge.
