 HONGQI ZHANG 123RF.comThe university's electrical and mechanical engineering courses also face a similar plight but, unlike LLB which has a deadline of October, WSU has until July next year to hire the academic staff for the engineering programmes and to ensure proper lecture halls. The Department of Higher Education has even set aside R183-million for WSU to be able to upgrade its lecture halls and science laboratory as well as hire staff to teach the affected courses. The Council on Higher Education (CHE) issued this stern warning to the university on Thursday. Three other universities, namely the University of South Africa, the North West University and University of Free State, also face losing their accreditation for the LLB degree. This comes after the CHE reviewed 21 South African universities. WSU has also been red-flagged for its electrical and civil engineering courses. WSU spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo confirmed yesterday that the university had been given until October to hire the qualified lecturers to teach LLB at its Mthatha campus. Tukwayo said WSU had also been given until July next year to improve the quality of teaching for electrical and civil engineering diplomas. Department of Higher Education spokesman Madikwe Mabotha said should the affected institutions not adhere to the CHE recommendations, their LLB courses would be suspended.
