He expressed optimism about reaching and surpassing the minimal viable number of potential subscribers needed to proceed to the formalisation of the initiative. &#x201c;We are confident that we will be proceeding, but need those brands which have not yet committed to come on board and be a part of this watershed initiative to ensure that independent, transparent, benchmarked, and audited research that will focus on brands, products, and segmentation in an integrated and consumer centric manner will once again be available to marketers and their agencies into the future.&#x201d; Saarf chairperson Virginia Hollis also confirmed that with two weeks to go until decision day, intent to participate has been received from a high percentage of the country&#x2019;s top advertisers across all significant industry sectors. &#x201c;We are excited by the levels of support we have received, and encourage all serious marketers who have not yet contacted us to do so as soon as possible. The new research will provide a single integrated view of the South African market. It creates continuity for defining target markets. It is geared to the strategic and planning needs of marketers and their agencies, and gives marketers control of the research design, specifications and processes. In addition, it will be modular in design, and can grow with marketers&#x2019; changing needs and market developments.&#x201d; Marketers and agencies should email Saarf: az.oc.fraas&#64;fraas to confirm their interest, or to request documentation that will facilitate their participation in the initiative.
