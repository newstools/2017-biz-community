The focus was placed on individuals being recognised for creating culture and who form part of a unique generation of creators. Capturing the images was 24-year-old photographer and digital artist Aart Verrips, who has worked with Vogue Italia and whose Gazelle collage received global recognition on Adidas Originals social platforms in 2016. The street level casting kicked off at Shelflife on Friday 24 March before heading to AREA3 in Braamfontein on Saturday 25 March and wrapped up at Thesis in Soweto on Sunday 26 March. Adidas Originals in Sandton hosted a version of the activation in-store, with a pop-up studio experience on Saturday 25 March. The portraits are used in a series of short format brand films, released as key campaign imagery and used in a 90s inspired AREA3 window display. Selected portraits will also be screened in designated stores.
