The winning public entry for Summer is by Nadia Williams, from Strand. Lourensford Summer winner Nadia Williams &#x201c;I love the idea of photographing something so plain and simple that could draw a story behind it. I captured this image by laying flat on the ground and trying to capture the sunlight coming through the trees &#x2013; how I chose to represent the summer season,&#x201d; said Williams. Lourensford has also teamed up with some of the country&#x2019;s leading Instagram photographers and the Summer winner in this category is Clifford Wort. Lourensford summer winner Clifford Wort &#x201c;When I took this image, I just tried to capture the stunning beauty of the Proteas found on the Lourensford farmlands, as well as the majesty of the Helderberg,&#x201d; said Wort. &#x201c;The Helderberg Mountain is one of my favourites and shooting it from Lourensford was one of the first things I did when I become serious about photography. I love bringing to life scenes through photography and the beauty of the Western Cape makes it easy for me.&#x201d; Both winners receive a Lourensford Estate Wine collection valued at R1,000. Their images are also eligible for the Grand Prize, which includes a one-night stay at Erinvale plus a Lourensford Estate experience valued at R5,00, to be announced at the opening of the inaugural #SeasonsOfLourensford exhibition in November 2017.
