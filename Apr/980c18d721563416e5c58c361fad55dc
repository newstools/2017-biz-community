Directed by Martin Werner of Czar, together with LS Productions, the film centres on the story of a coach instructing his English team in the Indian way, from eating and training to yoga and dancing.

Having put forward eight potential stadiums and scouted a further two (shortlisting three), Edgbaston in Birmingham was the client&#x2019;s final choice. As the fourth largest in the UK, with seating for 25,000 spectators, it made for an impressive backdrop. Amy Morement, location manager at LS Productions, explains, &#x201c;We struck gold with Edgbaston, as we were able to secure the entire grounds for the shoot, including the training area and changing rooms. The films were shot in winter, which meant that frosty ground was an issue, particularly as the groundsmen are understandably protective of their playing surface. We had to ensure that the 80-strong crew and cast members were sensitive and careful with the ground.&#x201d; Thorne Mutert, executive producer of Czar, comments, &#x201c;This was another great shoot with LS Productions in England, our third together. Edgbaston was exactly what we hoped for - the LS locations team gaining us complete access for a long weekend of shooting. With a large cast and crew, this made the job as easy as possible. Sarah and her team know their stuff, are flexible and make it fun.&#x201d; The one-day shoot followed two days of recce and preparation and utilised both a drone and a rain machine, with the only shot not filmed on location that of the plane scene, captured in Frankfurt, Germany. Sarah Drummond, executive producer at LS Productions, adds, &#x201c;It was great to welcome Czar, Thorne and the team back for the third time. The flexibility and support from the team made it in easy place to shoot &#x2013; even when we had to get a curry delivered at 10am on the Sunday morning to use for filming.&#x201d; CreditsAgency: Kolle Rebbe and MRM//McCann Production company: Czar Director: Martin Werner Executive producer: Thorne Mutert DOP: Jallo Faber Production servicing: LS Productions Executive producer: Sarah Drummond Location manager: Amy Morement</li></li></li></li></li></li></li>
