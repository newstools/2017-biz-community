The PBP constituted a promulgation of regulation working group in March 2017, consisting of PBP members and non-PBP members who would prepare the submission of the scope of practice to the minister of health. The Working Group has already commenced with its duties, which are to: review the judgement of the High Court case;review the regulations defining the scope of the profession and the scope of practice in consultation with stakeholders; and finalise regulations defining the scope of practice for promulgation.
