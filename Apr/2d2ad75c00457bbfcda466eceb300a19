The award categories are intended to showcase the diverse ways that business partners with arts projects, events and initiatives to bring the arts to the public in different parts of the country. &#x201c;Our annual awards are always a highlight of the arts calendar &#x2013; providing a reason to celebrate excellence in business and arts partnerships over the year,&#x201d; says Andre Le Roux, BASA chairman. In 2017, South Africa&#x2019;s foremost awards celebrating business and arts partnerships are part of a broader commemoration of Business and Arts South Africa&#x2019;s 20th anniversary. As it marks this landmark event, BASA has an invigorated focus on Growth, Research, Connectivity and Celebration &#x2013; all of which serve to confirm the organisation&#x2019;s standing in as a leading force in business and arts on the African continent. In 2017, the 20th Annual BASA Awards partnered by Hollard & Business Day will also be used to honour those who have contributed to the growth and success of BASA over the past two decades. This includes awards partners Hollard and Business Day, both of whom are founding business members of BASA. &#x201c;We are very proud to have been associated with BASA from the very beginning,&#x201d; says Heidi Brauer, Chief Marketing Officer at Hollard. &#x201c;Long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships which enable better futures are a part of Hollard&#x2019;s DNA and our relationship with BASA has definitely grown the impact the arts can and do have as a force for positive and enduring change in South Africa.&#x201d; Eleven categories are open for entry, including the Cultural Tourism Award, proudly supported by Nedbank.
