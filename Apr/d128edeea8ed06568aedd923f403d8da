Robertson Located just two hours away from Cape Town, Robertson is a relatively quiet town. Nestled in a fertile agricultural valley, it has been christened the valley of wine and roses. Although the name does capture some imagination of the pleasures found here, it does not entirely communicate the magic and splendor of a charming little town in the backdrop of some of the best wineries in the world. Apart from savouring world renowned brands like Graham Beck from Beck&#x2019;s winery itself, you can enjoy picturesque views of lush green fields, visit the Robertson art gallery, the birds paradise or even take on an adrenalin sport like skydiving.

Marvel at the 150-year-old Cape Agulhas Lighthouse and the museum that is the only one of its kind in Africa. If you ever dreamt of a shipwreck, the Spook Draai hiking trail will send chills down your spine. Struisbaai.

This small town is actually a village that dates back to 1857 and has been declared as a Heritage Site. The architecture is an attraction in itself but it is the Klein River that makes this little place such a popular destination. Some of the top attractions include river cruises, kayaking, bird watching and shark cage diving. If you like, you can also indulge in horse riding, hiking, or just find your way to the local coffee shop or antique store.
