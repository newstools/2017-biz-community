Adam WeberAdvertising agency M&C Saatchi Abel Joburg has appointed Adam Weber as partner and executive creative director. Weber, who began his career over 20 years ago, joins the partnership at M&C Saatchi Abel, coming from Joe Public. He has worked with several industry icons at high-profile agencies including Red Nail and Hunt Lascaris. &#x201c;M&C Saatchi Abel is positioned as an ideas company. Our creative philosophy of Brutal Simplicity of Thought demands that we produce ideas that are easy for the consumer to engage with, while delivering a return on marketing investment for our clients,&#x201d; notes Jerry Mpufane, Chairman of the M&C Saatchi JHB Group of Companies. &#x201c;We are committed to producing discipline-neutral ideas, and I am very excited that Adam's experience is a perfect match to our ideals.&#x201d; To build upon his natural talents and eye for design, Weber moved from design into art direction and then into creative direction. Having travelled the globe and accrued vast industry knowledge, Weber has also racked up a number of awards. These include accolades won at Loeries, Cannes, Clio and One Show. Weber has also been featured in D&AD for both art direction and illustration. &#x201c;While opportunities to be an executive creative director don't come around often, I haven't taken the decision lightly,&#x201d; says Weber. &#x201c;It's the next step in my career and an exciting personal challenge. I'm joining a great partnership and want to continue building on their success as both a creative and strategic force in the local and international market. These are interesting times for advertising and my focus will be on building an environment for the Joburg team to truly transform the landscape with their unique creative insights and abilities.&#x201d; Weber joins the fast-growing, independent global network, M&C Saatchi, started by Maurice and Charles Saatchi in 1995 after leaving Saatchi & Saatchi. The M&C Saatchi Abel Johannesburg office will certainly offer Weber unlimited opportunities to apply his creative talents and leadership skills, with an impressive array of high profile clients including Nedbank, Sun International, Nando&#x2019;s SA and AVI. &#x201c;This is a tremendous opportunity, and I&#x2019;m thrilled to be joining M&C Saatchi Abel, a true federation of entrepreneurs,&#x201d; adds Weber. &#x201c;Far more than an advertising agency, it is a creative company producing world class work while constantly seeking to create meaningful impact.&#x201d;
