A specially curated list of titles by different South African authors and in different languages, these books will reach 20,000 children across South Africa. Nal&#x2019;ibali is calling on the support of the public to help increase the number of books per child by donating new or gently used books at special readings taking place on Friday, 21 April. Special handover events with more than 100 partners will be taking place in the week of 17 April and members of the public who would like to support the drive are invited to attend special read-aloud events with local authors and renowned storytellers on Friday, 21 April. These read-aloud sessions will offer parents and children an opportunity to experience the fun of a Nal&#x2019;ibali reading club. Guests who gift books will each receive a full-colour hard copy of the Nal&#x2019;ibali Children&#x2019;s Literacy Rights Charter to take home. Open read-aloud events take place on Friday, 21 April: Gauteng: Bandile Sikwane will be reading aloud from his story, Malome Lerata goes to the Library, from 2pm at Thavela Youth Development project in Zola 2, 2337A, Matshaya Street, Soweto. Western Cape: Children&#x2019;s author, Christopher Gregorowski will read from one of his books, Fly, Eagle, Fly! at the Durbanville Library hall in Durbanville from 2pm. KwaZulu-Natal: Ukhozi FM narrator, Sanelisiwe Ntuli will do the read-aloud at Times Knowledge Learning Foundation, Dassenhoek Library in Mariannhill at 2pm. Nal&#x2019;ibali has been supporting a growing movement of South African children and caregivers who enjoy reading and sharing stories since 2012. This is done by providing free access to good quality stories in English and home languages through its web- and mobisites; its bilingual reading-for-enjoyment supplement, and on more than 11 different radio stations each week. &#x201c;The most inspiring part of promoting a reading culture in South Africa is that many parents, caregivers and community-based organisations are already reading and telling stories to their children! Now, through this generous donation by the DG Murray Trust &#x2013; an initiating and funding partner of the Nal&#x2019;ibali campaign, we are able to gift the children supported by our partners with hard copies of books,&#x201d; said Jade Jacobsohn, Nal&#x2019;ibali managing director.
