African cities called for the creation of a dedicated desk for local governments within the Green Climate Fund during COP22. They expressed the hope that a capacity-building program would be set up to make them eligible for the Green Climate Fund and other climate finance instruments. African cities also proposed that UCLG Africa should be recognised as an implementing agency for the Green Climate Fund. The workshop will be an opportunity to provide concrete ideas for implementing these recommendations in UCLG Africa's presentation during COP23 in June in Bonn, Germany.
