A post shared by McDonald's South Africa (@mcdonalds_za) on Apr 3, 2017 at 11:04pm PDT The special was available on the morning of 4 April and offered the restaurant&#x2019;s signature breakfast item, the Egg McMuffin, with a McCafe coffee for R10. Pocket-friendly and a crowd pleaser, the promotion was sold out at numerous outlets across the country before I stepped foot into the Sea Point branch at what I thought was an early 9am. I was to meet with Greg Solomon, McDonald&#x2019;s South Africa&#x2019;s spirited CEO. Engineer turned self-proclaimed &#x2018;burger guy&#x2019;, he initially joined McDonald&#x2019;s in 1996 as a project manager in the construction department. Greg SolomonSince stepping into a leadership role, Solomon has been credited with the company&#x2019;s sales growth, increased guest counts, improved customer service and increased operating income year on year. He has also been instrumental in the evolution of the restaurant chain&#x2019;s product offering, which has gone from burgers to breakfasts to coffees and delivery. Big Mac for lunch, McMuffin for breakfast While many expected McDonald&#x2019;s to launch breakfast with the standard two eggs, toast and bacon substitute &#x2013; they're 100% halal &#x2013; the brand had other ideas. &#x201c;Here comes McDonald&#x2019;s with an English muffin, poached egg and a slice of smoked turkey. We weren&#x2019;t sure at the time if South Africans would understand this breakfast, but that was 10 years ago and now it&#x2019;s 12% of our total business,&#x201d; he said. The breakfast menu has expanded since then, now incorporating low-carb wraps, proudly South African boerewors patties and even oats. Despite the menu's popularity, Solomon says more growth would be welcomed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d love even more growth, in some other countries around the world breakfast is 20% of their business.&#x201d; Transformational journey Breakfast was just the start of the brand&#x2019;s transformational journey. According to Solomon, as a restaurant chain that operates 24/7, you can&#x2019;t rely purely on lunch or dinner. You need to have a diverse offering. &#x201c;We started off with breakfast 10 years ago, and then five years ago we said what about coffee?&#x201d; Enter the McCafe brand and its 100% Arabica espresso-based coffees. While he admits coffee competition is rife, McDonald&#x2019;s believes it&#x2019;s found the ideal balance of value and quality. &#x201c;You can have a real barista cappuccino for R17 at McDonald&#x2019;s versus going crazy at R40 for a cappuccino elsewhere.&#x201d; The McCafe offering along with McDonald&#x2019;s Delivery, which launched 18 months ago, have proved to be good moves in the cementing of McDonald&#x2019;s as a contemporary South African brand. &#x201c;This is the journey of a modern, progressive burger business.&#x201d; Everyday value McDonald&#x2019;s doesn&#x2019;t run promotions like National Breakfast Day often, instead choosing to concentrate on offering constant good value to the 8 million customers its branches see a month. &#x201c;We spend a lot of time talking to customers saying that at McDonald&#x2019;s you can get it really good and you can get it cost-effective. For us, it&#x2019;s about everyday good value, and keeping costs as low as possible without compromising on quality or taste.&#x201d; African expansion In terms of expansion into Africa, Solomon is frank about not being overly-ambitious. &#x201c;At this point in time we have our beady eye on Africa but we&#x2019;ve got our focus on South Africa. Our prime focus is the South African consumer, and we want to make sure we get that right first. In two or three years, I think we&#x2019;ll grow more aggressively into the rest of the continent.&#x201d;
