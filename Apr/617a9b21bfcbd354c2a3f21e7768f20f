 Leung Cho Pan via 123RFTesting is expected to be complete by June 2017, and from there installation of the technology is expected to begin on Qantas&#x2019; domestic fleet of Airbus 330s and Boeing 737s. The roll-out across 80 aircraft will be completed at the end of 2018. The Qantas system offers speeds up to 10 times faster than conventional onboard wi-fi and gives customers the ability to stream movies, TV shows, music and news programs - including through content partnerships with Foxtel, Stan, Netflix and Spotify. In the interests of other passengers, however, voice calls will not be allowed. Qantas group CEO Alan Joyce says: &#x201c;Inflight wi-fi has been on our wish list for quite a while, but the sheer size of Australia meant it was hard to offer a service that was fast and reliable. The nbn has made it possible and we&#x2019;re really pleased to be able to tap into this service.&#x201d; &#x201c;On flights between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, where we have a lot of business travellers, we expect the system to get a real work out with email and web browsing.&#x201d;
