Dale SimpsonA city hotel for an ageless crowd The hotel &#x2013; channelling an ageless millennial mindset &#x2013; will open its doors in the third quarter of 2017, and is set to shake up the South African hospitality industry with its bold new philosophy. According to Dale Simpson, curator of Radisson RED Hotel V&A Waterfront, Cape Town, the hotel will offer an exuberant and unique take on modern hospitality. &#x201c;Radisson RED embraces freedom, flexibility, fun, and will bring these elements to life through a whole new type of guest experience.&#x201d; He says that he can&#x2019;t imagine a global location better suited to the RED way of life than the Silo District. &#x201c;The V&A Waterfront, together with leading architects, has transformed six grain silos into modern sustainable spaces. We&#x2019;re a city hotel for an ageless expressive crowd, and by occupying Silo Six, we&#x2019;re right in the heart of the bustling Waterfront, amidst the city&#x2019;s vibrant nightlife, only 25 minutes from Cape Town International Airport, and all the while boasting Instagram-worthy harbour and mountain views.&#x201d; The Cape Town Radisson RED hotel follows successful launches in Brussels and Minneapolis, with Campinas and Glasgow set to launch soon. It will be the fourth RED property to be launched globally and the first in Africa. &#x201c;The response to the launch of these properties has been awesome, and we have no doubt that Cape Town RED will be embraced by locals and unshackled global travellers alike.&#x201d; Graven Images - Radisson RED Cape Town Art at the heart of RED Adding to the buzz will be the highly-anticipated Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA), set to open on 27 September. &#x201c;Art is always at the heart of RED and our dynamic design is both inspiring and functional,&#x201d; says Simpson. &#x201c;So it just makes sense that we&#x2019;d be neighbouring the world&#x2019;s largest museum dedicated to showcasing contemporary art from Africa and its diaspora.&#x201d; Forget stuffy hotels and rigid rules However, Simpson assures that it&#x2019;s not only the hotel&#x2019;s dynamic location that will prove attractive to guests. &#x201c;Radisson RED is inspired by the trends and lifestyle of the ageless millennial, tapping into modern, high-tech travellers. In addition to our 252 contemporary rooms and fully equipped gym, the hotel will house four events and games studios for up to 90 guests &#x2013; ideal for hosting high-octane meetings and social occasions. &#x201c;It probably goes without saying, but guests will be able to access super-fast free Wi-Fi and 24/7 entertainment tech throughout the property. Additional good news for all animal-lovers out there is that all fur babies of 8kg or under are welcome to stay at the hotel too.&#x201d; Graven Images - Radisson RED Cape Town For the more chilled guest, Simpson suggests the RED Roof as the ideal early to late hangout. &#x201c;Celebrating the best views of Table Mountain, this will be the spot to sit back and enjoy a craft beer or take a splash in the pool. While food and drinks can be enjoyed at the OUIBar and Ktchn, our resident trendy restaurant and bar, there will also be the option to order in via the RED app for those wanting some down time.&#x201d; He says that Radisson RED is set to ignite the African hospitality experience. &#x201c;Forget stuffy hotels and rigid rules. Radisson RED is a revolution. From keyless entry to multifunctional social spaces, we&#x2019;ve reinvented everything. We&#x2019;ve made new rules. Welcome to the REDvolution Cape Town.&#x201d;
