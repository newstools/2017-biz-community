Norman Kin Hang Chan 123RF.com&#x201c;We always had a feeling that South Africans would take Starbucks to their heart but we were all floored at the scale of the welcome we received in Johannesburg,&#x201d; says Taste Holdings CEO, Carlo Gonzaga. &#x201c;Over the last year, the brand has seen a rise in its artisanal, small-batch Reserve coffee with its proprietary coffee machine, the Clover, receiving the most interest,&#x201d; says Gonzaga. Consumers are adopting digital solutions and the brand has been a mover in innovation in this space. In February, it launched its loyalty programme, Starbucks Rewards that rewards customer loyalty and offers a complete payment solution through an app. It is growing rapidly, as customers start to feel the speed and simplicity of payment and reward. Gonzaga concludes, &#x201c;In the next few months, we aim to bring the Starbucks experience to more South Africans and in more innovative ways. We are proud to be here in South Africa and we look forward to opening more stores, employing more partners and being a big part of the communities we serve.&#x201d;
