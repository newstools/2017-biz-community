 Jozsef Szasz-Fabian 123RF.comThe Lusushwane Bulk Water Supply project is aimed at providing water to the rural communities of the Chief Albert Luthuli Local Municipality. The project, from phase one to phase three, is funded by the Department of Water and Sanitation with the Gert Sibande District Municipality as the implementation agent. The scheme in all its phases is valued at R90,151,000. On completion, it will benefit communities including Bettysgoed, Smithfield, Oshoek, Lochiel, Robinsdale, Aankomst, Pampoen, Houtbosch and Hartbeeskop. Speaking at the sod turning ceremony on Friday, 7 April, Mokonyane said all the work that the department does is meant to develop the lives of women, girl-children, and more so the youth, particularly the Africans, who were always at the tail-end of the services value chain. &#x201c;We are here to ensure that this bulk supply project really is off the ground because it is vital for the socio-economic progress of at least 16,000 people in the vicinity. It is a scheme that is also cognisant of all kinds of growth, including economic and population,&#x201d; Mokonyane said. As the scheme continues to operate, the minister said there needs to be a way of ensuring that the infrastructure does not collapse, that being through continuous operations and maintenance. &#x201c;The availability of water must also impact upon better sanitation solutions. Teams will be set up to ensure that in the next two months a plan be put in place to look at how sanitation services can be improved.&#x201d; Expressing the necessity to protect infrastructure, Mokonyane said it is essential to recognise that the infrastructure in place is meant to service all members of the community. &#x201c;Each member of the community has an equal responsibility to protect all water and sanitation infrastructure, together with all other infrastructure that supports communities.&#x201d;
