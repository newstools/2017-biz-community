WTM Africa 2017 saw over 700 exhibitors present, with over 8,000 pre-scheduled appointments for the duration of the show &#x201c;While we had anticipated a great response from our attendees, we&#x2019;re pleased to report we have had an overwhelmingly confident response around WTM Africa 2017. This year, we looked to innovate on popular events such as Speed Networking, but also enticed visitors with new additions such as the Outbound Theatre, an expanded ibtm africa programme, and a dedicated media speed networking session,&#x201d; says Chardonnay Marchesi, general manager of Africa Travel Week. The exciting announcement that the Sports & Events Tourism Exchange is to form an integral part of Africa Travel Week in 2018, was a highlight on day two of WTM Africa. This collaboration will bring together travel professionals and potential sports tourism events, in a bid to increase the number of events hosted on the African continent.
