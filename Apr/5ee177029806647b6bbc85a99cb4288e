TOD is reportedly gaining traction internationally as the new paradigm for transport and development planning. In essence, it aims to achieve more sustainable and equitable cities. This roundtable opens up a dialogue around what TOD means in Cape Town and how our understanding of streets can be enriched by the concept. The format of the evening is four 15-minute presentations by guest speakers, focussing on particular themes. This will be followed by a facilitated discussion which will last 45 minutes exploring the topic. Street Minds is an initiative facilitated by OSCT that strives to create a platform for learning centred around streets as an integral part of cities. It brings together professionals and practitioners from a range of backgrounds in a spirit of openness and exploration, as we work to improve and empower good street design in line with the Open Streets Manifesto.
