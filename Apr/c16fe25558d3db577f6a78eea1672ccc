Beyond its support, however, Lancewood wanted to introduce a new and interactive element to the viewing experience for Ultimate Braai Master fans. Their solution came in the form of Emoji Meals &#x2013; a social media tool powered by a bot that takes the Ultimate Braai Master viewing experience to a different level of delicious. Lancewood partnered with advertising agency M&C Saatchi Abel CT to execute what was a first for the brand, and a pioneering use of emerging digital tools. &#x201c;We needed a mechanism that would allow the brand to not only engage its strong following on social media, but to also provide something entirely new and immediately relevant to this audience &#x2013; at a specific touchpoint,&#x201d; says Gordon Ray, executive creative director at M&C Saatchi Abel. &#x201c;The combination of great content with a smart social media platform provided the perfect solution.&#x201d; By simply sending a food emoji to Lancewood &#x2019;s Facebook page via private message, the Lancewood bot instantly responds with an interesting recipe or practical tip related to the emoji. For example, Clarissa* sent the brand a strawberry emoji and the bot responded with a recipe for fruit cheese salad with strawberry vinaigrette &#x2013; a completely different and unexpected twist on the traditional braai salad! So by harnessing the power of real-time social media engagement to provide relevant and original content to fans, Lancewood instantly turned the Ultimate Braai Master viewing experience into a far more dynamic and engaging event. According to Shereen Anderhold, Marketing Manager at Lancewood , the response from the Lancewood Facebook community has been sensational. About 2,002 unique users have already tried out the Lancewood Emoji Meals bot, and approximately 165,715 interactions have taken place. She notes that over a million viewers have already tuned in for the second episode. &#x201c;Given that people are inundated with marketing messages on social media today, and particularly on Facebook, Lancewood Emoji Meals allowed the brand to cut right through this clutter,&#x201d; adds Ray. &#x201c;For many South Africans, food is a passion &#x2013; and we found a way for Lancewood to become an integral and very tangible part of an activity that South Africans love and cherish.&#x201d; For more information on the Lancewood Emoji Meal bot, visit the Lancewood Cheese Facebook page.
