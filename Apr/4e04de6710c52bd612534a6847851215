Klose was raised in Kenya, South Africa, Germany, and the United States and now resides in New York City. His music has been streamed over 1,000,000 times online and his song &#x2018;Make It Better&#x2019; is featured on the Billboard Top 10 charting compilation album &#x2018;Action Moves People United&#x2019;. His songs have been heard on the Grammy nominated 'Healthy Food For Thought' compilation as well as MTV Cribs and movies Dead Broke (Warner Bros) featuring Paul Sorvino and A Venue For The End Of The World (BrinkVision) featuring Dick Cavett and Ian Anderson. Most recently, Klose scored the music for the award-winning short The Beauty of Disaster. Last week Klose arrived in South Africa to begin recording his new album at Academy of Sound Engineering in Johannesburg with a number of top South African artists. What makes this project even more exciting is that Archbishop Desmond Tutu&#x2019;s charity, TutuDesk, is his chosen charity for this PledgeMusic campaign. I caught up with Klose last week whilst in pre-production for the album. What does music mean to you? It&#x2019;s my foremost mission in life. I grew up not being allowed to learn an instrument. Very conservatively raised by my German grandparents, long story. So, I made my own way and never looked back. Any funny moments on stage? Well, painfully funny. I broke a string and poked my finger and started bleeding all over the fretboard of my guitar. I didn&#x2019;t notice until some screamed out from the audience: &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; Your heroes? Prince probably, and Joni Mitchell, and John Oates (who I&#x2019;ve actually performed with. He&#x2019;s a survivor of the highest order and a great and informed musician and lovely human being. Pete Seeger also someone I performed with. All these artists never stop working. It&#x2019;s your round, what are you drinking? Oh, a good glass of South African red, preferably a Syrah! When it&#x2019;s a bigger celebration it&#x2019;ll be a classic vodka martini with olives or a makers mark Manhattan. The song you wished you wrote? &#x201c;Song To The Sire&#x201d; by Tim Buckley/Larry Beckett but it&#x2019;s okay, I love singing and performing it and it feels like my own. Dream gig to do? Rock n Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. I was a high school exchange student in Cleveland. Nicknames? Yanni (or Janni) but I hate it. If you were not a musician what would you do? Swim! Pick five words to describe yourself? Workaholic, dreamer, lover of life. 5 Desert Island Discs? Joni Mitchell &#x201c;Court and Spark&#x201d; Prince and the Revolution &#x201c;Parade&#x201d; The Beatles &#x201c;Revolver&#x201d; Led Zeppelin &#x201c;Houses of the Holy&#x201d; Daft Punk - Random Access Memories Greatest movie ever made? Oh, that&#x2019;s easy. Some Like It Hot starring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon. Directed by Billy Wilder and music by Adolph Deutsch! Favorite fashion garment? Italian leather boots. Give us some real proper slang and what it means. Well, since I&#x2019;m in New York I&#x2019;ll say &#x201c;oy vey!&#x201d; which basically means that the proverbial S#@! has hit the fan. What do you complain about most often? Internet speeds (or tempo in general). What is your fear? Wasting time. On stage I tend to? Sweat! What are you doing next? Recording my next solo album in South Africa with producer RJ Benjamin and many very special guests!
