The size and sheer scale of Euroshop is something to behold, as its only held every three years, it attracts many of the major suppliers to the retail sector and covers almost every sphere of retail. Software There were a number of unique offerings on display at the show and some of the more interesting developments were in retail software, such as Retail Display Management (RDM), where they are able to track the shoppers journey through the store, analyse customer metrics and store compliance, as retailers can see all merchandising efforts in real time. Lighting The use of specialised lighting to accentuate in-store product has developed significantly, many of the largest stands having been those showcasing these unique lighting techniques. LED technology within the retail space has also grown from specialised signage applications to digitally enhanced product placement showcases, along with the use of smart technology developments. Retail focus Point of sale Point of sale products remain very strong within the retail sector, and this was evident in the number of offerings on show. This is also true of fabric and aluminium framing systems, where a significant amount of retailers rely on the combination of these products to grow and drive sales. This is particularly gratifying for Clarion, as our offering of the Faster Display POS systems and our Matrix fabric framing solution, are perfectly positioned to continually add value and assist in driving the sales efforts of our customers. Retail innovation Integrated technology A strong impression from the show was how retailers are relying on software technologies that integrate seamlessly with instore product, specifically to grow sales through a unique customer interaction.
