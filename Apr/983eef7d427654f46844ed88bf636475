Radisson RED CT OUIBar & KtchnNot only will entrants be in line to win a whopping 10,000 smackeroos, they&#x2019;ll also have the golden opportunity to be part of Cape Town&#x2019;s hottest hotel&#x2019;s design team. Designs so chic that guests will want to take them home as souvenirs Dale Simpson, curator of Radisson RED Hotel V&A Waterfront, Cape Town, says that the innovative design competition is open to all South Africans, regardless of training or experience. &#x201c;Whether you&#x2019;re an artist, a student, or just someone with a strong interest and love for design, we&#x2019;re calling on you to enter one of our three categories or, better yet, enter them all. The first category focuses on a design for a 250ml takeaway coffee cup, the second for a 350ml takeaway coffee cup and the third for a beer mat - AKA the coaster. Each designer will need to use the templates provided online to submit their designs.&#x201d; Simpson says that apart from having their work showcased to a variety of local and international art-loving guests at the grand opening event, the winning designs will also be visible in various places throughout the hotel. Dusty brown tea trays move over please &#x2013; our designers have spoken. When thinking of beer mats - visualise a stylish spot for your pale ale to rest. We&#x2019;re looking for designs so chic that guests will want to take them home as souvenirs. Marie Vogts, manager and curator of Youngblood, says that she is especially excited about this collaboration. &#x201c;Capetonians often don&#x2019;t get to connect with hotels - because why would you stay in a hotel in your hometown? However, through the competition we are getting all locals involved and excited about this new development. Sound like your kind of competition? Here&#x2019;s what you need to do: Let those creative juices flow, create a design that can be easily replicated on a variety of surfaces and submit your best RED-inspired work to the #REDexperiment via Youngblood Africa Foundation. Entries are open, so download full details and an application form the visual arts section of Youngblood Africa Foundation. The submission deadline is 12 May 2017 and finalists will be informed via email on 19 May 2017. Join us at Youngblood Africa gallery in Cape Town for the official awards ceremony and exhibition on First Thursday, 1 June, where the winners will be announced and all the participants&#x2019; designs will be on display. After that, all designs will be displayed at the hotel&#x2019;s Grand Opening event later this year. Winners can expect a VIP invite in their inboxes.
