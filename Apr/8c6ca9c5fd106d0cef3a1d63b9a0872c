The image doing the rounds on social media calling for the national shut down on Friday - #StayAwayFridayThis, following messages doing the rounds on social media, calling for a shutdown of the country on Friday, 7 April 2017. Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) on Monday said it has noted the call for a shutdown, which can have unexpected consequences especially for the country&#x2019;s fragile economy, business and communities. The department&#x2019;s acting Director General Donald Liphoko said whilst the public has a democratic right to embark on protest action, government does not support acts of civil disobedience and the actions of a select few to infringe on the constitutional rights of the majority. &#x201c;When citizens take to the streets illegally, we often witness violence, destruction of property and lawlessness. These illegal protests do not possess the characteristics of strengthening democracy. Those found guilty of any form of violence will face the might of the law,&#x201d; said Liphoko. Government is of the view that South Africans can engage each other on differences through meaningful dialogue and through appropriate platforms. The department said the social media messages are sent to bring the image of South Africa into disrepute, to disturb the economy and to create the impression of disorder and fear in communities. Civil society organizations, business and society at large are encouraged to work with government in strengthening the country&#x2019;s democracy to create a better South Africa and contribute to a better and safer Africa.
