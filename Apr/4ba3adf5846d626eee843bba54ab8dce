Renee Perkins&#x201c;I was attracted to the franchise by my father&#x2019;s experiences. He was national operations manager for the company until 2010, when he bought his first franchise. Now he owns the top two stores in Durban, at Greyville and Pinetown. My goal is to grab that title for my new store. &#x201c;Dad asked me if I would consider managing his first store in Greyville, Durban, for him. It was a lot more than just changing jobs. I was born and brought up in Gauteng and I had my husband and children to think about. But we all leapt at the chance to live beside the ocean.&#x201d; The art in finding a fair price When Bruce Perkins bought his second franchise in Pinetown in 2013, Renee took over management of that as well. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been looking after the admin, dealing with staff and working on the floor with customers and stock. I have found it fulfilling because there is an art to finding a fair price that works for you and for the customer. &#x201c;You also need to create goodwill with customers and that way you build up your regulars as a basis of your clientele. I learn something new every day, even if it is how some strange gadget works so that we can talk knowledgeably about it when we sell it on.&#x201d; The business model offers training on dealing with customers as well as other business issues. Renee believes that making the most of resources like this is central to succeeding as a franchisee and an excellent way to improve your business skills. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what gave me the confidence to go ahead and buy the Oxford Village franchise when the opportunity came up. I had to decide very quickly and I am sure I will never regret it. It is a chance to develop my skills further as well as consolidating our family business within the franchise.&#x201d; She is already revamping to the new store design, obtaining various licences and legalities and switching over to a new computer system.
