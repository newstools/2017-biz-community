We roped SeeSawDo in to design and paint a mural that would showcase all the various Plascon products and their uses in a way that was charming, colourful and could easily live in an actual hospital ward. From there we set out to replicate the scenes in reality. We always love working with kids and this little girl really shone. We hope you like it!
