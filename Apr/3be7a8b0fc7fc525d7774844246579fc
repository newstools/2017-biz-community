One of the many national teams in store The brand is synonymous with making mornings a little easier with their handheld breakfast, introduced back in 2009. On Tuesday, 253 stores nationwide shared their "Little Moments of Lovin'" with 500 consumers per store - making it a whopping 126,500 breakfasts going out in one morning to hungry patrons across South Africa. This mammoth task was seamlessly executed by the brand's long-time partner agency, OLC (Offlimit com). Delivering memorable experiences is not new to the brand, which has consistently and fearlessly delivered world-class experiential campaigns for a bellyful of international and local brands across the board. What sets them apart is their relentless pursuit for bringing unimaginable ideas to life, making them leaders in the consumer experience arena. "We believe in having the best minds come together to imagine, challenge each other and break barriers in execution within the world of activations. This simply can't be done without an airtight cohesion within the team. At OLC one of our focused strategy has been to build a very talented, agile and solution driven team," said OLC MD Jerome Cohen. The agency can best be described as the "creative hub" where big ideas come to play - which would explain the exponential growth within the workforce.
