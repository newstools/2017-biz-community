 Chalermpon Poungpeth via 123RFLast week, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) signed and entered into a technical agreement with the Autoridade Reguladora Das Communica es, the communications regulatory authority of Mozambique. This is an agreement of co-operation and co-ordination in respect of spectrum management for telecommunications and broadcasting services, and will see the establishment of a technical committee which would address matters of common interest between the two regulators on radio frequency co-ordination. In terms of this agreement, the two regulators shall work together to ensure, among others, co-operation on the co-ordination, control and management of radio transmission spill-overs, exchange of information and expertise in the field of radio communications. &#x201c;It is our commitment as regulators to make expertise, infrastructure and equipment available to assist each other on regulatory matters, including radio frequency spectrum investigations, possible cross-border spill-overs and of course, co-ordination of our services,&#x201d; said ICASA acting chairperson, Rubben Mohlaloga, after signing the agreement. The technical agreement is a culmination of the memorandum of agreement entered into by the two governments in June 2015, aimed at finding new approaches and strategies for consolidating, expanding and deepening areas of economic development, industrial, and trade co-operation between Mozambique and South Africa. &#x201c;This is a critical step for us as regulators because we have a common goal of ensuring that the needs of our people are taken into account and that their service consumption is exactly what they pay for and interference-free,&#x201d; concludes Mohlaloga.
