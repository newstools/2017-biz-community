And while being stuck in an East African gridlock all day might not sound too exotic, it helped enormously that the first commercial's storyline was set inside a matatu. Which gave Markstry time for plenty of takes - in Swahili - to get the performance he wanted. Then it was on to another location in Nairobi that looked exactly like an English church in a setting in Lagos. (Sound crazy? Watch the ad and you'll get the full picture.) But whether directing in Nigerian Pidgin or in Swahili - or even, as is usually the case, in English - for Markstry performance is paramount. And boy, does it show. Check out the results for yourself. And then call us to give your script the exotic performance it deserves.
