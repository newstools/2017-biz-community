About Inspiring Fifty Inspiring Fifty is a Dutch-based non-profit organisation that showcases inspiring female role models in the technology industry in the Netherlands, France, Europe, and the Nordics. Built on the core philosophy &#x201d;If she can see it, she can be it&#x201d;, it annually awards the 50 most inspiring women in the technology sector with the aim of providing a platform that brings more visibility to the achievements of women in the innovation and technology sector. Inspiring Fifty has now partnered with the Kingdom of the Netherlands to launch the initiative in Africa, creating the first platform of inspiring women in technology outside Europe. &#x201c;The African tech ecosystem is growing exponentially. This is re-shaping the South African economy as technology and innovation are leapfrogging beyond established technology, ideas, and infrastructure. The instrumental role played by women in this sector should be made more visible on a local and global level. These women are the inspiring role models for the future," says Inspiring Fifty co-initiators Janneke Niessen and Joelle Frijters. Creating a platform "Inspiring Fifty South Africa allows us to create a platform for these women in technology, showing our girls that they can do the same.&#x201d; says Bonnie Horbach, the Netherlands Consul General in Cape Town. The collaboration forms part of the Dutch campaign in South Africa, named #cocreateSA. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re thrilled to be moving this initiative to the African continent as we share the same important goals around inclusive economic growth, diversity, innovation and entrepreneurship. We look forward to collaborating, to co-create and shape ideas to bring about positive and lasting change to the sector across the globe,&#x201d; says Niessen and Frijters. There is ample evidence on the critical benefits that diversity brings to innovation, problem-solving and creativity. Based on these insights, it is clear that there is no shortage of opportunities for women in the industry.
