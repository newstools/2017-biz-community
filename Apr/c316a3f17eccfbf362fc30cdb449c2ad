And that Noakes was not guilty of negligence or providing advice without sound information. Four of the five committee members found that it was not proven that Noakes had acted in capacity as a doctor. Nor that it was a reasonable inference that he was undermining the benefits of breast milk. "On the facts, this committee finds that no actual or potential harm was proven or that any information provided on Twitter by the respondent, whether unsolicited or not, was dangerous or life threatening," Adams said. Noakes has welcomed the finding.
