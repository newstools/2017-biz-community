&#x201c;The full field of more than 20 drivers are very excited about the prospect of showing their true mettle on the new tarmac of Kyalami,&#x201d; says Mike Rowe, head of Volkswagen Motorsport. &#x201c;The circuit is beautiful and the surface is perfect, but more importantly, it is also very wide and offers plenty of passing opportunities which will result in great racing for the many fans and supporters of the Engen Volkswagen Cup. And from a driver&#x2019;s point of view, it&#x2019;s the one race that everyone wants to win most as the circuit&#x2019;s combination of tricky corners and fast sweeps provide a true indication of one&#x2019;s raw speed and talent.&#x201d; Someone with loads of raw speed and talent is current championship points-leader Shaun La R serv e who sits on 28 points following a victory at last month&#x2019;s season-opener in Cape Town. However, neither La R serv e or Tasmin Pepper will be on the Kyalami starting grid this coming weekend. But in Lee Thompson and Dewald Brummer, the team did find two worthy replacements. Both are former race winners and both will be very eager to impress. Devin Robertson and Clynton Bezuidenhout are currently tied on 22 points apiece on the points table following successful outings in Cape Town a month ago. Robertson managed to conclude a deal which will now see him contest the full championship. Juan Gerber is only one point back and in fourth on the points table. Gerber was the pole-setter in Cape Town and will be determined to convert his pace into race wins at Kyalami. Engen Volkswagen Cup action will kick off with the first practice at 10am on Friday, 21 April 2017. Official qualifying to determine the grid will take place at 8.40am on Saturday, while the first of the day&#x2019;s two races will start at 11.20am.
