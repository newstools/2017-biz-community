From 17 March until 5 May 2017, Frankies Flashback Activation is urging consumers to spot the new retro Frankies van, which will be visiting markets, universities, media houses, malls, varsities, office parks and railway stations in the Gauteng area. Consumers can sample eight unique flavours and stand a chance to win retro prizes and Frankies product hampers. National and regional print, digital and radio partners will be giving consumers an opportunity to win product hampers by spotting the van&#x2019;s location on the day. They need to take a picture of themselves at the Frankies van and tweet or post it to @FrankiesSA on twitter or on the Frankies official Facebook page using the campaign hashtag #FrankiesFlashback &#x201c;Consumers resonate well with the wholesome values from yesteryear. The Frankie&#x2019;s retro &#x2018;look and feel&#x2019; is bringing excitement to the South African market, whilst also adding something different to the carbonated soft drink category,&#x201d; states Thoko Zungu, senior brand manager, Clover. In 2015, Clover SA acquired Frankies Olde Soft Drink Company, founded by husband and wife team Mike and Paula Schmidt in 2006.
