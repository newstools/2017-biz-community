Brands of today are operating in both an exciting and challenging time. The development of online media has created endless ways to communicate and connect. These infinite choices are both a benefit and a burden &#x2013; the increasing complexity of communication leaves many companies confused and craving simplicity. MediaCom believes that everything is connected. For this reason, the company aims to ensure that paid, owned, and earned communications work together harmoniously to increase brand competitiveness, while reducing wastage. That is why, even though MediaCom was founded as a media agency, it has transformed into an agency that thinks and operates in a new and groundbreaking way. The MediaCom Beyond Advertising (MBA) division is a testimony of this evolution. Revlon ramping up its digital presence in 2017 MBA sits at the heart of MediaCom. The division&#x2019;s conviction is that content only achieves its potential when it is designed, managed, and integrated within every other element of a communications system. MBA&#x2019;s focus is threefold: content strategy, content creation, and content distribution. Various brands are taking notice of this, which is why MBA is growing rapidly on both a global and local scale. This approach, combined with MediaCom&#x2019;s track record of executing numerous award-winning campaigns, convinced Revlon&#x2019;s decision-makers that it was the right fit for their vision to expand online in 2017. As the digital agency on record, MediaCom Beyond Advertising will deliver on all digital, social media, and content strategy &#x2013; from execution to implementation.
