Once promulgated into law, the Property Practitioners Bill will repeal the current Estate Agency Affairs Act 112 of 1976. &#x201c;This Bill is part of Government&#x2019;s response to the changing market conditions and it seeks to create an enabling environment to enhance economic activity within the real estate sector. It will also help open up market opportunities for new entrants into the real estate sector especially black people who were previously disadvantaged,&#x201d; Minister Sisulu said in a statement. According to the Department of Human Settlements, the envisaged law will regulate issues of compliance and conduct and behaviour of property practitioners as well as promote transformation in the sector. The Home Loan and Mortgage Disclosure Amendment Bill will amend the Home Loan and Mortgage Disclosure Act 63 of 2000. It will also help to regulate on key human settlements matters as identified in the National Development Plan including, amongst others, issues on spatial planning, provision of housing finance and dealing with complaints from home loan holders. &#x201c;The Home Loan and Mortgage Disclosure Amendment Bill will ensure compliance by financial institutions and improve lending conditions and patterns,&#x201d; Minister Sisulu said.
