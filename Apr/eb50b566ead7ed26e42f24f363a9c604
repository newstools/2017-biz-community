 Jovan Selakovic via 123RFDecathlon is a helping to develop sport and industry globally. Their choice to set up West Africa&#x2019;s biggest sports store in Ghana is in appreciation of the many strides Ghana has chalked up over the past 60 years. The opening of the Decathlon store at the Junction Shopping Mall, Nungua in Accra marked the first of many. Decathlon intends to open over 50 stores and factories across the country in order to produce locally a major part of what will be sold in their shops. Ghana&#x2019;s Minister of Trade and Industry, Alan Kwadwo Kyerematen, said: "I welcome Decathlon's development prospects in Ghana which ties into the government&#x2019;s &#x2018;one district, one factory&#x2019; project." The French ambassador extended: "I am pleased with the contribution of a French company to the development of added value and employment in Ghana." Decathlon&#x2019;s Sports for All campaign echoes France&#x2019;s overall approach to sports and Paris&#x2019; bid for the 2024 Olympics. Decathlon is committed to making sports accessible and affordable to every Ghanaian by launching the Sports for All Campaign (#sports4all), a campaign dedicated to encouraging every Ghanaian to pick up sports as a lifestyle. This event takes place at the outset of a series of economic, cultural and educational events under the theme "France and Ghana 1957-2017: moving forward together". It illustrates the commitment of French people, and economic and social actors to sport in general.
