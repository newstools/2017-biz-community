In 2015, the global tally of malaria reached 429,000 malaria deaths and 212 million new cases. One child died from malaria every two minutes. "Any death from malaria &#x2013; a preventable and treatable disease &#x2013; is simply unacceptable," said Dr Pedro Alonso, director of WHO&#x2019;s Global Malaria Programme. "Today we are urging countries and partners to accelerate the pace of action, especially in low-income countries with a high malaria burden." Ninety-one countries reported ongoing malaria transmission in 2015; all are working to reduce their malaria burden through the deployment and use of WHO-recommended preventive, diagnostic and treatment tools. Global technical strategy 2016-2030 In May 2015, the World Health Assembly approved WHO&#x2019;s Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016&#x2013;2030, a 15-year blueprint for all countries working to control and eliminate malaria. The strategy set ambitious targets for 2030, including reducing malaria case incidence and death rates by at least 90%, eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries, and preventing the reintroduction of malaria in all countries that are malaria free. Interim 2020 targets call for 40% reductions in malaria case incidence and death rates and for the elimination of malaria in at least 10 countries. Less than half of the world&#x2019;s 91 countries with malaria transmission are on track to achieve these interim targets for case incidence and mortality reductions. However, prospects for achieving the 2020 elimination target are bright: WHO&#x2019;s Eliminating Malariareport, published in 2016, identified 21 countries with the potential to achieve at least one year of zero indigenous cases of malaria by 2020.
