Stephen Woodford, chief executive at the Advertising Association said, &#x201c;Advertising has proved resilient to uncertainty and behind these numbers is a cutting edge, digital business in which Britain is a world-beater. As we work towards Brexit, we're urging government to support UK advertising and do more to unlock its potential to grow UK plc.&#x201d; James McDonald, senior data analyst at Warc commented, &#x201c;The UK's ad industry is experiencing the most seismic shift since Warc began monitoring in 1982. Last year exemplified this, as over 95% of the new money entering the market came from digital formats. The trend will continue as ad tech improves and consumers spend more time with their internet-connected devices.&#x201d; The Advertising Association/Warc Expenditure Report is the only source that uses advertising expenditure gathered from across the entire media landscape, rather than relying solely on estimated or modelled data.
