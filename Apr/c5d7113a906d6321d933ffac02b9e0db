The SAGSP initiative is comprised of six thematic areas: Waste management - to promote waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse and recycle) and waste management projects; Energy efficiency & conservation - to promote energy awareness, audits and energy saving strategy; Water management and conservation - to promote planning and optimum utilisation of water resources eg rainwater harvesting, water usage audits, irrigation methods; Landscaping, tree planting and beautification - to contribute to carbon offsetting and beauty of the school; Public participation and community empowerment - to instil sense of environmental responsibility in communities (knowledge and skills); Leadership and institutional arrangements - to develop school environmental policy, vision, mission, strategies and plans to achieve greening projects and awareness Today&#x2019;s children are tomorrow&#x2019;s decision makers and they need to be equipped with the knowledge of intricacies of the workings of the environment, which gives all biological beings their livelihood. Unfortunately, many children have few opportunities to experience nature. Excitement about nature and caring for environment should be modelled to children to instil enthusiasm. Environmental education based on life experiences should begin during the very earliest years of life. Beginning this process in the early years, when attitudes toward the world around them are forming, is essential. Such experiences play a critical role in shaping lifelong attitudes, values and patterns of behavior toward natural environments. Children's attitudes toward living things develop at a young age and they will imitate the attitudes and actions toward caring for the environment that is modelled for them. Speaking at the launch, Deputy Minister Thomson encouraged the school leaners to become ambassadors for the environment for the sake of the current and future generations. &#x201c;The care for and protection of our environment has to start at a young age and I would like to express my thanks to everyone involved in taking this proactive step to nurture in our younger generation an appreciation of the importance of environmental care and protection.&#x201d;</li></li></li></li></li>
