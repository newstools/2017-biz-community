This pioneering course is aimed at adults (pre-school teachers, care-takers, parents, etc.) who work with children from birth to 3 years of age. Lectures will focus on Early Childhood Development (ECD) and a comparative study of the child, family and community while exploring the relationship between these aspects and Montessori education. Successful completion of this course leads to being awarded the internationally recognised Assistants to Infancy (0-3) Diploma from AMI. The curriculum includes topics such as Montessori philosophy, psychology (theory and practice), anatomy and physiology, hygiene, obstetrics and nutrition, music, art, development of language and movement, spiritual development as well as observation of the young child under 3 years. &#x201c;At IMI we support adults in working with children during the most formative years of their life. Through gaining knowledge of the Montessori method guided by the AMI standards, each adult is given the tools to support every child to be the best they can be,&#x201d; said Emma Snowball, Indaba Montessori Institute Project Manager. &#x201c;The AMI 0-3 course is now being offered in South Africa to give the opportunity to people from all around the continent to train in this way, which is of huge importance if we wish to implement early-years education that is focused on truly supporting the needs of the child. &#x201d; The application form for the course is available on the IMI website or hard copies are available at the Sustainability Institute.
