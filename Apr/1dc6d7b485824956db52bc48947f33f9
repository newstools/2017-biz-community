Rene Albasini from the SACSC and Professor Chris Cloete from the University of Pretoria.Cloete said, &#x201c;Since inception some 20 years ago, we have seen a steady increase in the number of students who register for these courses. The retail and shopping centre industries have huge impacts on the economy and GDP. These industries need skilled and learned individuals who can help grow this industry even more.&#x201d; Amanda Stops, SACSC CEO, congratulated all the students who excelled in the 2016 intake of the CSCM and ACSCL courses and encouraged other professionals and individuals who are in the retail and shopping centre space to participate in the 2017 courses. &#x201c;It is inspiring to see so many people participate in these specialised courses and share their experiences with us. We at the SACSC aim to provide up-to-date and relevant information, research and educational courses for our members. This inevitably grows the industry and shapes tomorrow&#x2019;s retail and shopping centre leaders.&#x201d; The CSCM course is designed to impart the principles and practice of shopping centre management and development to participants. The ACSCL course is a more in-depth look into the shopping centre and retail industry focusing on many topics such as town planning procedures, market research and financial mathematics to name just a few.
