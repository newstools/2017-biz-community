&#x201c;This is a great online simulation game in which participants must work together in teams of four to save a fictitious food company &#x2013; The Fresh Connection &#x2013; from financial ruin,&#x201d; says Tonya Lamb, sales and marketing manager at SAPICS, the South African partners in this global competition. SAPICS is a professional knowledge-based association for the supply chain community across Africa. How it works Each of the participants in a team will play one of four crucial roles in turning the business around purchasing, sales, operations, and supply chain. &#x201c;The format of this competition provides excellent opportunities for learning, growth and exposure to other supply chain management strategies and thinking,&#x201d; said Lamb. Participants experience the impact of value chain management on business performance and see the effects of creating alignment and breaking down functional silos. She urged local supply chain professionals to take advantage of this opportunity, and to register before the 24 April 2017 deadline. Encouraging innovation &#x201c;To make the game more demanding, the organisers introduce curve balls that force teams to reconsider their strategies and find innovative ways to deal with unexpected challenges,&#x201d; she says. The competition runs until June, and the best-performing teams face up against each other in the Global Final on 28 September 2017 in Lisbon, Portugal.
