Whereas most online stores are about selling and promoting their own products, Rabaki is giving locals an opportunity to become part of the outlet and earn 5% commission for selling its merchandise. According to the company, this new feature will allow both individuals and small businesses to grow and expand the opportunities around them with extra income to increase their stability in tough economic situations. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re excited to launch this new reseller feature because we believe that this will help empower both the unemployed and employed South Africans and small businesses,&#x201d; says Larry Kgatle, spokesperson for the company. &#x201c;The unemployed youth no longer have to define themselves as another statistic in the youth unemployment rate and small companies are allowed the opportunity to create more employment prospects out of this reseller feature.&#x201d; The company plans to launch a merchant registration feature soon, which will allow small to medium companies to sell their own products in the store. &#x201c;The merchant registration will play an integral role in developing small businesses that would like to sell and showcase their products. In the meantime, however, merchants who are interested in joining our online store will be given the option to submit their products manually for listing in the store.&#x201d; The site is owned by Rabaki, in partnership with Zartner Technology and Rams Comics.
