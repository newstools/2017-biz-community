Market and consumer response to the new-look magazine has been overwhelming, with Good Taste being one of the only print publications nationally to show a 13% increase in total circulation in the latest ABC results &#x2014; who said print is dead? Liza Weschta, General Manager of Good Taste, predicts an even bigger increase on total circulation in the next ABC results. This will be due to Good Taste going on shelf in Woolworths from the May/June issue, as well as an increased presence in slow lounges around SA, and increased distribution through wine farms and various wine clubs that form part of Wine-of-the-Month Club. &#x201c;One of the reasons the brand is doing so well is that we are extremely lucky to be able to consistently customise the publication according to what our readers want; because we own our own database we are able to consistently communicate with our members/readers regarding their content needs,&#x201d; says Liza Weschta. Wine-of-the-Month Club is South Africa&#x2019;s leading independent wine club and was the first wine club to be established in 1986. This year marks their 30th anniversary for delivering ultra-premium wines to members&#x2019; doorsteps. Each year the Wine-of-the-Month Club&#x2019;s panel blind-tastes over 2,000 wines, to bring its members the best wines possible. The best part? The panel only takes into account what&#x2019;s most important: what&#x2019;s in the bottle. The beauty of blind-tasting is that the judges select only the best tasting wines regardless of price, label, farm or winemaker. &#x201c;We are able to offer our advertisers a niche top-end audience. The average personal income of our reader is three times higher than any lifestyle publication on shelf. Most of Good Taste readers have also been loyal members of our wine clubs for more than five years,&#x201d; says Liza Weschta. Good Taste&#x2019;s new editor, Kari Collard, says, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re creating a different kind of magazine that&#x2019;s filled with highly curated content across food, wine, wellness, decor, design, travel and art. We want to create a sweet escape where readers can go offline, switch off their phones and lose themselves in our carefully crafted and inspirational pages.&#x201d; Although Good Taste is about the finer things in life the publication also has a strong focus on living well and encouraging a life in balance. The pages offer aspirational, practical and uplifting articles, filled with resources and tools to inspire you to slow down and live a kinder, healthier, happier life &#x2014; all in good style and good taste.
