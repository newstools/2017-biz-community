"Volvo Cars fully supports the Chinese government's call for cleaner air as outlined in the latest five-year plan. It is fully in line with our own core values of environmental care, quality and safety," says H kan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo Cars. "We believe that electrification is the answer to sustainable mobility." China is the world's largest sales market for electrified cars and has ambitious targets to expand sales of fully electric and hybrid cars in order to address congestion and air quality issues in its cities. Volvo is also developing a fully electric car on its larger Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform. The Swedish company also plans to offer plug-in hybrid versions of every model in its portfolio. The all-new model will be available for sale in 2019 and will be exported globally from China.
