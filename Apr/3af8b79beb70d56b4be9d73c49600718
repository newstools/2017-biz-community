aha Shakaland interiorAn invigorating touch was added to the rooms which were re-painted, along with the addition of new linen, and introducing the nguni hide mats. The outdoor area is spruced up with newly revamped pool and outdoor furniture that reflects the striking rustic scenery. The buffet area in the &#x2018;Shisa Nyama&#x2019; restaurant which offers an exquisite mixture of traditional Zulu food with touches of modern cuisine will also receive an upgrade. The Siyafunda Centre, which comprises of traditional dormitory huts accommodating school or university groups visiting aha Shakaland on cultural excursions, has also been spruced up through the inclusion of new bunk beds and new floor tiling, adding to the overall African milieu of the establishment. The refurbishment also extended to the conference centre which sports a modest upgrade. aha Hotels and Lodges CEO Neil Bald says: &#x201c;These renovations will be carried out in phased stages, to avert any impact on our guests. Since the huts are set in mini villages, construction in one village will have no adverse impact on the daily undertakings of the establishment. Our guests can thus be assured of the same warm and attentive service they are accustomed to at aha Shakaland.&#x201d; &#x201c;Our guests' safety and comfort is of paramount importance, therefore the rewiring of the peripheral electrical fence was essential and the re-thatching of the huts which will take place during the upcoming dryer KwaZulu-Natal seasons,&#x201d; Bald concluded.
