&#x201c;The ultimate goal is to create a genuine mixed-use eco-neighborhood where it is pleasant to be, work, live and play; an eco-neighborhood along the Brussels canal, articulated around three axes: revitalisation of the built heritage, sustainable communities, and water,&#x201d; write the architects. Although their plan is yet to be approved, the architects envision transforming the site into 50,000m2 of mixed-use space including retail spots, business parks and public amenities. The project also includes the eco-design of three residential "vertical forests" totalling 85,000m2 as well as the creation of a large pond bordered by a natural and biological pool which links the Tour & Taxis park to the Brussels canal. Ultimately, the project tackles the idea that new sustainable design cannot be achieved in the already industrialised environments found in developed regions. The redevelopment joins a group of vertical forest constructions underway in various regions around the world. Find out more about the project.
