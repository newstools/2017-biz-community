With the recent economic upheaval, widespread protests from citizens, and calls for President Jacob Zuma to resign, stability isn&#x2019;t a word that could be used as a descriptor for the state of the nation. Nope. Instead, Twitter users needed at least three others today to describe South Africa as acutely as possible. #SouthAfricaIn3Words is one of those hashtags that don&#x2019;t stem from any particular news story, or furthers one general rhetoric, but rather takes a look at a single issue from a number of different, and often polar opposite sides. But unlike people reminiscing about their high school years, or chatting about why they log into Twitter in the first place, this hashtag seems to mean a bit more to the country&#x2019;s Twitter folk than most. Here&#x2019;s just some of the themes running through the tweets. South Africa is &#x2018;ran by Guptas&#x2019; Propelled by general anti-Zuma sentiment across the country&#x2019;s social network and on the ground this past week, many are using the hashtag to have a jab at President Zuma (oh, and the Guptas too), calling for the end to corruption and state capture. Zuma autocratic president. #SouthAfricaIn3Words pic.twitter.com/zxY2WjT4Be&#x2014; Honourable Radebe (@tholakele15) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words Ran By Guptas&#x2014; April 14,2017 (@terranova_ep) April 10, 2017 Zuma sold us #SouthAfricaIn3Words&#x2014; But Im not a rapper (@Barh_Mzimela) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words most corrupt place&#x2014; bradley (@lyricalbrad) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words where Gupta's Dominate&#x2014; Touchofsoul (@Tebzakhumalo1) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words Zuma is trash.&#x2014; #AllEyezOnMeMovie&#xfffd;&#xfffd; (@drew_bat) April 10, 2017 In South Africa &#x2018;whites own land&#x2019; Putting Zuma aside completely, others used the hashtag to comment on South Africa&#x2019;s lopsided economic and land distribution status, and the still palpable racism prevalent in the country. #SouthAfricaIn3Words Whites Own Land&#x2014; Seopela Wa Afrika (@Hector_Maoto) April 10, 2017 Property of whites #SouthAfricaIn3Words&#x2014; I am unstoppable (@BrianAtuheire) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words Whites over Blacks &#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd; pic.twitter.com/SFbFo9Nd7f&#x2014; IG: Melow_Mokoena (@MelowMokoena) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words whites own it pic.twitter.com/INQAz3O8KE&#x2014; iFinesser (@nguOdwa_) April 10, 2017 Some also called for the end of racism in its entirety. #SouthAfricaIn3Words STOP BEING RACIST&#x2014; Devin S (@DevonSM37) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words Racism Must Fall&#x2014; SIBONGILE NTULI&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd; (@Sibongile_Dust) April 10, 2017 South Africa is &#x2018;imperfect yet promising&#x2019; Then there were the hopeful few, explaining that all South Africans need to &#x201c;do better&#x201d; to further the country. Others expanded on the country&#x2019;s &#x201c;possibilities&#x201d; through its imperfections, while others tweeted images of South Africa&#x2019;s natural beauty. #SouthAfricaIn3Words we need change&#x2014; BIG BASH (@sbuda_Mfecane) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words let's do better&#x2014; BIG BASH (@sbuda_Mfecane) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words imperfect yet promising&#x2014; Tjitji Lamayne (@hi_ImKAYBEE) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words Place Called Home &#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#x2014; IG: Melow_Mokoena (@MelowMokoena) April 10, 2017 #SouthAfricaIn3Words alive with possibilities.&#x2014; Coolaid (@im_visionary) April 10, 2017 South Africa could be &#x2018;the Next Zimbabwe&#x2019; Finally, many users opted for nihilism. Monday might have something to do with that, of course. Nevertheless, many suggested that the country is &#x201c;fucked&#x201d;, and that it&#x2019;s well on its way to becoming the &#x201c;next Zimbabwe&#x201d;.

It also demonstrates that a country like South Africa can&#x2019;t be quantified by a single hashtag. Even though Twitter users might try, that single hashtag can mean many things to many people.
