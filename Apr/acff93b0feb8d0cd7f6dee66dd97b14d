South African consumers can now choose from 19 KB derivatives in three body types, the newest addition to the range officially badged as the KB 250 X-Rider 4x2 Double Cab. At R388,400, the newcomer represents a unique blend of versatility and comfort. There's a heavy-duty tow bar as standard, giving the X-Rider a 2.1-tonne braked trailer towing capacity. And with peak torque kicking in at just 1,800rpm (and remaining constant all the way to 2,800rpm). Remote keyless entry, satellite controls on the steering wheel, air conditioning and projector headlights with daytime running lights all contribute to car-like levels of comfort, convenience and safety. All Isuzu KB models are sold with a fully-comprehensive five-year/120,000km warranty and roadside assistance programme, a five-year/unlimited mileage anti-corrosion warranty and a five-year/ 90,000km service plan. Service intervals are 15,000km or twelve months for all derivatives.
