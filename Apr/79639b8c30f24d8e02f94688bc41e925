As there are no quotas for awards at D&AD, the number of awarded entries fluctuates year to year. This means some years no Black Pencils are awarded: the record currently stands at just six - keep your eyes peeled! We&#x2019;ll have the final tally as soon as embargo lifts. To keep up with all the latest from D&AD, visit www.dandad.org for more information and be sure to follow @DandAD and the official #DandAD17 hashtag on Twitter.
