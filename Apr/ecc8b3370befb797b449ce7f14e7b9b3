 Michael Simons 123RF.comThe South Africans will take on teams from 22 other countries in the global final. The WITS and UP students won the local KICC competition conducted by KPMG in South Africa. KICC is an annual competition for top students who are challenged to develop solutions for real-world business cases. Taking place over four days, student teams&#x2019; presentations are judged by a panel of senior KPMG partners, progressing through multiple rounds before the winners are announced on Thursday, 13 April 2017. This year, the business cases will focus on fintech and disruption of the financial services industry, and how big data can be turned into actionable business insight. Learning experience Bilal Moosa, senior manager Graduate Recruit for KPMG in South Africa says, "KICC is an amazing opportunity for students to compete with their peers globally in addressing real-world business issues. They receive first-hand coaching and feedback from KPMG professionals and get a true sense of what it is like to work as a professional services consultant. Not only is it a great challenge, it is also a great learning experience for all involved. KPMG in South Africa, Johannesburg, hires 450 graduates annually and this programme provides the opportunity for us to give students an experience of what working at KPMG would be like."
