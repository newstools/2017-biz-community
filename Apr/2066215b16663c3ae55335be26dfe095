Davy is a model and make-up artist living in Johannesburg and Kuna is a DJ, producer, model and fashion design student from Johannesburg. Both are denim-lovers who use fashion as a tool to communicate who they are. First used on a line of affordable slim-fitting jeans, jackets and shirts, Levi's says its Orange Tab symbolised style and youth during the counterculture of the 1960s. Orange Tab 2017 features vintage-inspired finishes along with updated fits and fabrics. A new addition to the bottoms range is a vintage kick flare and a zip front skirt with design features such as patch pockets and additional belt loops. Men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s tee&#x2019;s feature Levi's logos and prints pulled from the Orange Tab archives, while the iconic trucker gets some Orange Tab touches in the form of arcuate pockets and zip fronts. &#x201c;I think the youth of today want to rebel against what people think is normal, no one wants to be the same as someone else. We want to stand out in the crowd and we choose to do that through fashion,&#x201d; says Davy and Kuna when pointing out the similarity between the youth of today and the rebellious denim-wearing youth of the 60s.
