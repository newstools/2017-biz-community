But I propose something a little more concrete. Actual plug-ins. Integrated functionalities. That I believe Facebook users in particular would appreciate. They should function as a barrier to entry, so that if a user cannot pass a basic but specific test, he or she cannot use the platform. (c) Thomas Pajot - 123RF.com Here&#x2019;s an overview&#x2026; 1. A comprehension captcha If a Facebook user is unable to read a short piece of text and comprehend, with a significant degree of accuracy, the messaging conveyed within, without making up his own version of the writer&#x2019;s meaning or missing the point completely, he should be unable to leave a comment in relation to that post. 2. A narcissism altimeter If a user develops a history of sharing semi-nude selfies, glistening full body shots, duck-face photos or a snapshot reflected in any kind of bathroom mirror, she should be required to undertake a narcissism self-test before posting further content. She should also be stringently vetted, in a separate process, for her use of #justsaying, #sorrynotsorry, #blessed and #lovemylife. 3. An anti-assholery gauge If a user appears to be striding through Facebook with the objective of being an asshole to others, whether in the form of troll-y comments, bigoted content, or mean bullshit that starts with &#x2018;Sorry, but&#x2026;&#x2019;, he should have his access curtailed. This functionality, for practical purposes, might also be integrated with a &#x2018;dipshit dipstick&#x2019;, to proactively weed out assholes-in-training. 4. An integrated irony plug-in If a user is manifestly deficient in intellect &#x2013; resulting in being patently unable to identify the use of dramatic, situational or verbal irony; tolerate a well-intentioned joke; or recognise a spoof, parody or instance of satire; she should have her account fitted with an integrated irony plug-in. 5. A basic spelling self-test If a user cannot, at first attempt, correctly use the following words (with or without the aid of a spell-checking plug-in or online dictionary), he should not be able to share opinions on Facebook: Lose / looseIts / it&#x2019;sTheir / they&#x2019;re / thereOf / offQuite / quietTo / too / two Now, these are the Fantastic Five, if you will, but there are three others that, based on demand, might be worthwhile as well: the overshare indicator; the anti-whinging widget; and the all-important heartstrings margin (for users who compulsively share photos of animals looking for &#x2018;a forever family&#x2019;). If you have the contacts (a cousin who knows someone who knows Uncle Mark, maybe?) or the brains to assist with this development, I&#x2019;d appreciate it. If not, I&#x2019;d like to know what I&#x2019;ve left out. What functionalities do you think should be a barrier to entry on social media? Sound off in the comments.
