The acquisition of Progress Milling seeks to bring that 80-year old business out of business rescue proceedings, which it has been subject to since early March 2016. The consortium is looking to implement both acquisitions as soon as possible.The mergers will alleviate the financial difficulties experienced by Progress Milling and Noordfed, which could have resulted in the loss of more than 400 jobs in the event of a closure.  More than 14,000 subsistence farmers in Limpopo hold claims against Progress Milling valued at an aggregate of R18.4m for maize meal deliverables. The acquisition of Progress Milling involves the recovery in full of those claims, which would have been largely irrecoverable in the event of the mill’s failure. Progress Milling will continue its maize-intake programme with these farmers, whose stable food source consists of maize meal.Exciting new opportunitiesPietermaritzburg-based Willowton Group is South Africa’s largest sunflower seed crusher and one of the leading companies in the country’s fast-moving consumer goods’ (FMCG) industry.

LDC has been present in South Africa since 1925, originating, processing and distributing white maize, wheat, rice, edible oils, oilseeds (sunflower and soya). This merger is a substantial addition to LDC’s existing asset base in the country, which already includes participation in sunflower seeds crushing plant, a rice packing plant and wheat mills.Commenting on the merger approval, Thomas Couteaudier, Africa Head, said: “For LDC Africa this investment is a step further into downstream value-adding activity. We are especially pleased that the merger will help sustain the livelihoods of many, including employees and small-scale farmers around Polokwane who will be allowed to bring maize and draw maize meal from Progress again.”
