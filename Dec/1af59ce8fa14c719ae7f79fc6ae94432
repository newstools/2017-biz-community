President Paul Kagame on 26-28 March 2018. Central to the NEF's vision of propelling Africa onto the global scientific stage, the NEF ambassadors will attend the NEF Global Gathering in Kigali, connect with each other and scientists from across the world. While growing their own careers through mentorship and collaborations offered by a growing network of partners, NEF Ambassadors drive the NEF's local public engagement activities like the NEF Africa Science Week, and will help craft an exciting and high impact forum. "The 45 selected ambassadors, eighteen of whom are women, are helping transform their local community through national campaigns like GirlsInSTEM, through research in renewable energy, food security, fin-tech etc. Beyond just theoretical research, our ambassadors have developed impressive technologies from their research. We look forward to shining a light on their initiatives and technologies which we believe are solving local and global challenges," said Thierry Zomahoun, president and CEO of AIMS and chairman of the NEF. Selection processNEF ambassadors are selected using a holistic process that reviews academic achievement, entrepreneurial abilities and recent public engagement efforts, particularly online. Ambassadors also have to demonstrate a passion for raising Africa's scientific profile and inspiring the next generation of scientific leaders. "I would like to thank the first Ambassadors Class who ran the first ever NEF Africa Science Week and continue to run impactful campaigns to mentor the next generation of scientists and technologists. Together with this new Ambassadors' class, they join the newly launched NEF Community of Scientists, an exclusive network that offers members research collaborations, networking and speaking opportunities and career mentorship. In return, members will participate in national and continental policy formulation, cross-cutting research and innovation activities, lead public engagement around science and technology in Africa, and provide mentorship to early-career scientists and students," said Zomahoun. 2017-2019 NEF ambassadors:Meriem Benmardi (Algeria)Donald Semevo Elian Tchaou (Benin)Yame Nkgowe (Botswana) Abdrahamane Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) Paterne Gahungu (Burundi) Sara Baptista (Cape Verde)Arielle Kitio Tsamo (Cameroon) Francis Mbaibo (Chad) Mandingha Kosso Etoka-Beka (Republic of Congo) Raissa Malu (DRC) Ghislain DESSIEH (Ivory Coast)Dr. Basant Motawi (Egypt) Mussie Mengistu Habtom (Eritrea) Binyam Sisay Mendisu's (Ethiopia) Yannick Ovono (Gabon) David Jeng (Gambia) Peter Asare-Nuamah's (Ghana) Keita Alpha Kabinet' s (Guinea) Dr. Rose M Mutiso (Kenya) Michael Sonneyboy Gboneh (Liberia) Kusai Fteita (Libya) Mireille Harimalala's (Madagascar) Chikondi Shaba (Malawi) Souleymane Sogoba (Mali) Abdoulaye Sidiki BA (Mauritania) Lakshana Mohee's (Mauritius) Dr. Lahbib LATRACH (Morocco) Lars Albino Lemos (Mozambique)Aibate Hatago Sturmann (Namibia) Halimatou Hima Moussa Dioula (Niger) Obidi Ezezika (Nigeria) Bobson Rugambwa (Rwanda) Paulo Emanuel D'Alva (Sao Tome and Principe) Khadidatou Sall (Senegal) Jessica D'unienville (Seychelles) Salwa Supckie Campbell (Sierra Leone) Dr. Sadiyo Siad (Somalia) Keabetswe Tebogo Ncube (South Africa) Mohammed Kamal (Sudan) Sifiso Musa Nkambule (Swaziland)Dr. Lwidiko Edward Mhamilawa (Tanzania) Aglago Dodzi (Togo) Joanitah N Nalubega (Uganda) Stephen Malunga Manchishi (Zambia) Ian Nyasha Mutamiri (Zimbabwe) Download their complete profiles here.The NEF is currently looking for Ambassadors for the following countries: Angola, Comoros, Guinea Bissau, Equatorial Guinee, Central Africa Republic, Djibouti, Lesotho, South Sudan and Tunisia.
