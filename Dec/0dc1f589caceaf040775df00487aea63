But while Suzelle starts the episode praising Tali as “gorgeous” and “fabulous,” things quickly get tense as Tali and Suzelle disagree over, well, everything, really.   Suzelle and Tali are both played by actress Julia Anastasopoulos and co-created with her husband, Ari Kruger, who directs both shows. Ari is also known as one of only three South African directors to have directed two Vimeo Staff Picks, the short films Jakkals13 and Focus.  <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/421529-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Kruger, behind the scenes…" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...
