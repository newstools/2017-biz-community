According to TDS operations director Willie Pieters, the two firms frequently collaborate on pipeline projects. “Due to the competitive nature of the market, TDS Projects Construction and Robor decided to work together on projects where pipes were to be supplied and installed,” says Pieters.The planned pipeline will consist of a 13km-long 400mm pipe column. The highest point will reach 1468 metres above sea level, and the lowest point will lie at 1200 metres above sea level. The pipe column design was drawn up to be suitable for pumping slurry at a pressure of 64bar.
