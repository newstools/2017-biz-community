The Paris deal was sealed under US President Barack Obama, but his successor and climate sceptic Donald Trump pulled out of it in June.The miner said its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia remnains beneficial. But it threatened to quit the council unless it stopped lobbying for coal.Brynn O'Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said BHP's decision to cut ties with the WCA "is a seismic shift in the world of anti-climate lobbying"."It is an emphatic market signal that the era of aggressive anti-climate lobbying is no longer acceptable," O'Brien said in a statement.The decision to exit the WCA came as some governments look to move away from coal-fired power, a key driver of global warming and air pollution.Global demand for the fossil fuel is forecast to remain flat between 2017 and 2022, resulting in a "decade of stagnation for coal consumption", the International Energy Agency said Monday.Rio Tinto, the world's second-largest miner, in September completed the sale of most of its Australian coal assets to China-backed Yancoal.Rio's divestment drive is expected to lead to a complete exit from the coal sector.
