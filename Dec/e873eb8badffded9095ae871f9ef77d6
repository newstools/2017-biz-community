The Festival has always evolved, and I am certain it will continue to evolve as the industry changes and thrives as it has for 65 years.”He continued, “Post Cannes, through the business opportunities I have before me, I will continue to ensure that the profound commercial and social impact of creativity takes a preeminent place in organisations around the world, and look forward to helping others achieve a like-minded position.”Philip Thomas, CEO of Ascential Events, commented, “Terry has been a huge figure in the history of Cannes Lions for decades – those who know him will know he is a big personality with a big passion for creativity and for the Festival he has worked on for so long. He leaves with our best wishes for the future, and we look forward to working with him as closely as ever in the run-up to the 2018 event.”For more:Bizcommunity search: Cannes Lions content in BizGoogle news search: Cannes Lions on Google NewsTwitter search: Cannes Lions Twitter searchOfficial site: http://www.canneslions.com, Facebook, Twitter, InstagramMore info: Cannes Lions special section
