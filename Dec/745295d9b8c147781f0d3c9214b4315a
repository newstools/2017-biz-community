As part of the programme, E² also provides initial seed funding support to these early-stage business ventures to help them create optimal business and operating models, as well as develop solid business cases that prepare and assist them to be ready and eligible to apply for follow-on funding to scale-up their operations. This they can do upon conclusion of the programme. E² is an active investor present throughout their candidates’ entrepreneurial journey, as their latest group of fellow entrepreneurs confirm.Oh My Cake!<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422633-625x325.jpg?1" alt="Oh My Cake co-founders Naseeha Hassen and Camilla Hyson" width="625" height="325">Oh My Cake co-founders Naseeha Hassen and Camilla HysonNaseeha Hassen, co-founder and confectionist perfectionist at the custom cake and macaron studio Oh My Cake! which is 50% black female-owned, says: “E² and the Allan Gray Fellowship have helped me start my business by giving me and my team far more than just funding: they have given us moral support, resources and constant motivation.

Their products are supplied to various supermarkets, fresh produce markets and small businesses. “E² has helped us develop a thorough understanding of many aspects of running a business: Finance, strategy, sustainability – and lots more,” says Thato Mahosi, one of three co-owners and directors of AgriMash.  Driven by a commitment to eradicating poverty in their community through sustainable agriculture, the three have grown their business from humble beginnings and today supply fresh produce to major retailers in Limpopo. “We wish to invest more in fixed assets to solidify the business, in turn, increasing our production exponentially during the E² programme and beyond,” concludes Mahosi.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422637.jpg" alt="Nkateko Kaytee Mathebula, Founder of Kaytee Automotive Company" width="250" height="309">Nkateko Kaytee Mathebula, Founder of Kaytee Automotive CompanyKaytee Automotive Company“I am going to change the world – and E² is helping me do this,” says a passionate Nkateko Kaytee Mathebula, founder of Kaytee Automotive Company, a Gauteng-based company specialising in high-quality parts and after-sales service for medium to large local commercial fleets. “E² has given me immense support outside of the funding arena. I had been working in the business alone for a really long time and the support they have given me was unexpected - and frankly a bit scary! They have pushed me to dream bigger, they have helped me focus on getting the detail right so that I can add value to suppliers and customers and are continually supporting me in what I dream about - instead of pushing someone else’s dream on me. The relationship is genuinely about seeing me reach my own goals.”Financing for future prosperityBesides their support to early-stage entrepreneurial ventures of Allan Gray Fellows, E² also supports impactful social enterprises focusing on five sectors: agriculture, education, energy, health, youth.“Together with the Allan Gray Foundation and the Allan Gray Association of Fellows, we have some of the brightest minds in the country,” says Pilime. “We enable Allan Gray Fellows and social entrepreneurs to build and scale high-impact organisations which will create jobs, attack poverty and contribute to economic and social transformation in South Africa.”
