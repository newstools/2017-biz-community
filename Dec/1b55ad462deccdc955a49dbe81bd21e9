The report also said workers concealed the practice from authorities during their visits to factories. The scandal came to light after the government ordered Japan's automakers to check their inspections following the recall of some 1.2 million cars by Nissan in October. Nissan said the vehicles had failed to meet domestic rules on final inspections.The embarrassing admissions have hurt Japan's auto industry, once the envy of the world for its just-in-time manufacturing and near-obsessive focus on constant improvement.Source: AFP
