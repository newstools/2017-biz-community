I don't understand what they are trying to achieve. They have already laid charges against me at the Hatfield police station for contravening this act," Pauw said.Pauw said he and his legal team would strongly argue that legislation could not be used to hide a crime."I don't think any journalist has ever been charged under the [Tax Administration Act], so it will be very interesting. But we will go to court and challenge them."Clear and compelling public interestNB Publishers said in a statement on Tuesday that it would continue to support Pauw and that it stood by the book."We believe that by bringing this application, Sars has conceded the truth of the parts in the book it names in the application," the statement read."We are proud to say we will defend our author and the book vigorously against Mr Moyane's application because there is clear and compelling public interest in The President's Keepers revealing that President Jacob Zuma has perverted the law-enforcement agencies of this country to hide the fact that he is not tax-compliant and that he received a salary from Roy Moodley's company while in office."The application was not filed as urgent and is expected to be heard early in the new year.Source: BDpro via I-Net Bridge
