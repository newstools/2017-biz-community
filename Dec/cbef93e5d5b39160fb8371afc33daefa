By exercising a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach with their clients, WeFuse focuses on four core pillars: Data Science, Integrated Marketing, Creative and Technology. When asked about these pillars, founder and CEO Dimitri Quadflieg explained, “WeFuse mines valuable data about businesses and their consumers, allowing the team to make strategic decisions around their business goals, ultimately steering them towards success.” WeFuse’s distinguishing quality is their “Fusion Approach”. This ever-evolving process is designed to ensure strategic, marketing and technological efforts exceed industry expectations by rapidly adapting at the rate of cultural trends. But it’s not all about Data Science. Creativity sits at the heart of WeFuse’s DNA. Powered by a creative team of design, production, technology and interactive specialists, WeFuse has a proven record of not only conceptualising creative strategies but also constructing and executing projects from inception to conclusion. Business transformation is the driving force behind WeFuse’s services; acting as catalysts for businesses to enter the digital landscape, such as e-commerce and mobile applications. Quadflieg reiterates, “WeFuse isn’t just an agency. We’re partners to our clients, ultimately, focussing our efforts on achieving results. We are digital creators; fuelled by our collective passion to innovate and grow businesses.” WeFuse fosters a culture of collaboration by considering the needs of their clients first, and then evolving those objectives with a progressive digital approach. With clients such as Converse, Captain Morgan, Smirnoff, Polo, Dickies and BetterBond, to name just a few, WeFuse is reinventing the digital marketing space.
