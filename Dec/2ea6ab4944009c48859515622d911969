The sea is not for all and this is something we may need to address more proactively in the future.”Eide said such interventions included building relationships with traditional leaders and their rural communities.“By recruiting future officers at an early age, from 16 to 19 years, and developing them, we can secure a stable qualified crew roster and create careers for promising candidates.”
