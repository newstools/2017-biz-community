If infection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions.High-risk foods“Foods which are most commonly identified as high-risk for Listeria infection range from improperly pasteurised dairy products such as milk, cheese and ice cream, to raw vegetables, poultry, fermented raw-meat sausages, and cooked or ‘ready-to-eat’ deli meats,” Jones adds.A research study by the Listeria Study Group notes that Listeria monocytogenes grew from at least one food specimen in the refrigerators of 64% of individuals with a confirmed Listeria infection (79 of 123 patients). In addition, 33% of these refrigerators (26 of 79) were also found to contain foods that grew the same strain of Listeria with which the individual had been infected - a frequency much higher than would be expected simply by chance.While anyone can be infected by the disease, certain groups are at higher risk. This includes:newborns;the elderly;pregnant women and their unborn babies; andimmune-compromised individuals with HIV, diabetes, cancer and chronic liver or kidney disease.PrecautionsWash your hands more regularly when handling food;Ensure that food is cooked thoroughly;Only use pasteurised dairy products; andstore food at safe temperatures. “It is essential that South Africans become more aware of the risks associated with food contamination and that they practice caution when handling food products, not only during times of disease outbreaks such as this, but in their everyday lives,” Jones concludes.
