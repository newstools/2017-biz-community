RFI reported that a military court in Yaoundé acquitted Abba of laundering the proceeds of a terrorist act, but upheld his sentence for non-denunciation of terrorism.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/419387-120x120.jpg" alt="Christiane Amanpour." width="120" height="120">Journalists honoured for courageous reportingInternational Press Freedom awards go to imprisoned Cameroonian journalist, Mexican correspondent, Thai reporter, and Yemeni blogger...20 Nov 2017The news outlet indicated he would be released since he already served 29 months in prison.Abba, CPJ’s 2017 International Press Freedom Award honoree , was  convicted and sentenced  in April this year to 10 years in jail on terrorism-related charges following his arrest on July 30, 2015 for reporting on the activities of extremist group Boko Haram.
