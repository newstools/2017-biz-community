XZIBIT assisted with the concept and design of event architecture to realise interesting event spaces for delegates to enjoy during the convention breaks. The use of eco-friendly materials was non-negotiable and our ideas for the various areas were influenced by interior design greening trends and the convention theme. Delegates were welcomed to the branded registration area that also accommodated speakers and media guests. The general area included an interesting activation themed 'Truth & Dare' that challenged delegates to answer truthfully about sustainable practices both personally and in their businesses. People were also given a 'dare' card to take away with an environmental message to consider. The backdrop of the fun activation doubled up as a photo wall with a botanical display amongst the GBCSA 10th celebratory logo. Convention delegates were able to charge their devices at various points in-between the seating areas as well as the fun bicycle charging stations that were powered by peddling. In keeping with the spirit of giving back we sourced the bicycles from Qubeka (the community mobile project that provides bicycles as a means of transport upliftment to rural areas). The bicycles were donated back into the community post the event. Private meetings took place in the experiential lounge area in a wooden dome shaped meeting pod.Another feature was the Lafarge coffee and donut bar where delegates 'dared to dunk' as they milled around the sponsors zone.
