The Department of Education: Ugu District Office integrates this with all the amenities that come with its central location, including easy access for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users, thus lightening its environmental footprint.The building features generous natural light with all office spaces having been designed and placed to have a direct line of sight to the outdoors. It has an energy-efficient lighting system and low volatile organic compound finishes. A further push towards sustainability includes parking spaces allocated specifically for two wheeled and fuel-efficient vehicles in close proximity to the entrance of the building as an incentive to encourage the use of these vehicles.Reduced carbon emissionsDuring construction, the majority of materials used were sourced within close proximity to the project, thereby reducing carbon emissions. Embodied energy was reduced through the use of industrial by-product in the concrete mixture and a large percentage of recycled structural steel. Dedicated areas for waste sorting and storage were allocated during construction and have been retained to date.Particular focus on this project was placed on creating employment for the local youth labour market, with 218 positions created during the construction and operation of the office.“Sustainable public spaces are resource-efficient and cost-efficient. Hubs of green building have the power to appeal to and attract economically active and skilled people to live, work and visit. The development of this Department of Education building is a fine example of the best practice sustainable development our public sector is delivering, and the GBCSA is here to work with every level of government to achieve their green goals,” concludes Modise.
