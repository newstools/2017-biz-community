It marries eaux-de-vie from a single distillery, which results in a smooth blend with elegant, fruity aromas, highlighting notes of the plum, apricot and candied lemon. House of Martell remains one of the few cognac houses to distil exclusively clear wines - a method that gives the final cognac its distinctive style. It has developed its own method of distillation using traditional Charentais copper stills. Supervised by cellar master Christophe Valtaud, the distillation team uses techniques and expertise that have been passed down from the time of Jean Martell, who founded The House of Martell in 1715 as a 21-year-old French merchant.Martell Cognac VS Single Distillery was launched in the US last month and South Africa is the second market in the world to receive it.“We are very excited to be launching Martell VS Single Distillery into the South African market as we feel it will be a game changer in the consumption and appreciation of cognac in this country,” says Sibusiso Shangase, head of prestige brands at Pernod Ricard. “Not many cognacs can look to fuse a celebration of historic French luxury cues in a contemporary African setting, and we believe this product will shape the future of how cognacs are appreciated in a rapidly developing African landscape.” Martell Cognac VS Single Distillery will be available from leading retailers countrywide.
