The change came after the station’s extensive engagement with its listeners, he said. “The reshuffling forms part of the station's drive to reinforce its legacy as the country's leading voice of youth culture on the airwaves. YFM is celebrating 20 years of being the voice of young people, as well as empowering and entertaining youth in Gauteng. An apt way to celebrate this legacy was to listen to the voices of our listeners.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422816.jpg" alt="#Newsmaker: Behind the scenes w/ DJ Ankletap" width="625" height="417">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why YFM and the breakfast show in particular? The station suits my brand the most and I’ve always been a fan of YFM. Since my campus radio days, the dream has always been to be a part of YFM and it happened that way, which is great. I am happy with any radio slot, but I think the breakfast slot suits me best because I have the right energy and sense of humour to make people laugh in the morning. It has proven to be a successful slot for me, and I am very happy to continue in the slot.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1204/98771-120x120.jpg" alt="First white DJ for Yfm primetime slot" width="120" height="120">First white DJ for Yfm primetime slotTholi B is taking over the afternoon drive-time show, youth radio station 99.2 Yfm announced this morning, Monday, 2 April 2012, and Bryce 'AnkleTap' Clarke becomes the first white DJ in a primetime slot since station's inception - he now hosts 'The Tap Mansion', 12 noon-3pm.2 Apr 2012.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on your previous experience and how it has led you to where you are today. I’ve been doing radio for over 10 years and have over 3,000 radio shows in the bag, including my campus radio days. The experience has helped me immensely especially with remaining calm, staying grounded and being able to deliver the kind of content and show that the listeners expect from a station with a high calibre like YFM.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1507/298062-120x120.jpg" alt="Miller SoundClash winner announced" width="120" height="120">Miller SoundClash winner announcedYFM's breakfast DJ Bryce 'DJ Ankletap' Clarke has won the Miller Genuine Draft South Africa Miller SoundClash, the international global DJ search competition.29 Jul 2015.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career? I’ve always been a very talkative person so the thing I love most about my career is being able to talk and express my views and know that so many people are listening to and identify with my views and/or sometimes opposed them. The best part of my job is my job – I love all of it.   .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why radio? I’ve always thought that I was meant to be on radio. I love talking and communicating. I also have a degree in psychology and communication, which fits perfectly with the radio game. Being on radio was a childhood dream and I am very happy to be living my dream. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What's at the top of your to-do list? The only thing on my to-do list as we wrap up the year is to start a new chapter of my life by proposing to my current girlfriend. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you currently reading/watching/listening to for work, besides YFM? I am very much a couch potato when it comes to watching different movies and series. I am currently watching BBC First’s Luther starring Idris Elba. It’s the best series I’ve watched in quite a while and I am very much hooked on it. I am also watching a lot of content on Cell C Black. And I'm a fan of cooking, so I'm constantly reading cookbooks and trying out new recipes..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to in 2018? The one thing I am looking forward to is getting back to work and starting a brand new year on YFM Mornings. Having started the show so late in the year, I’m looking forward to hitting the ground running and working towards having the best breakfast show in the country. Also, after the engagement, I’ll be looking forward to getting married and starting a new life as a married man and possibly starting a family.The new breakfast show, ‘YFM Mornings with Ankletap’ airs weekdays between 5am and 9am.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
