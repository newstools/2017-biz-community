What’s your claim to fame? That’s a tough one, but if I had to articulate it, I’d say, it’s most probably my ability to empathise with people and help them look a situation from a different perspective. But my friends might say, on a good day, my dance moves take the trophy!3. Describe your career so far. So far, my career has been a real Pandora’s Box. Basically, a never-ending, priceless life lesson.4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. Innovative thinking, sustainable solutions, sharing ideas – I truly believe that creativity has the ability and frequency to impact any industry positively. I also really love food, Asian food, to be specific. I enjoy staying fit, I’ve been a bit obsessed with swimming of late. 5. What do you love about your industry? I love the thinking that goes into the ideas we develop. Learning about different types of people – what they love, what they hate, what they find boring and how those things continuously change – it’s exciting and keeps me on my toes. But what I love most is adding value to people’s lives by introducing a new way of understanding something, a new perspective which helps them change their regular behaviour.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. No such thing. The only constant is ensuring that I read my book every day, usually fiction, just to feed the imagination.7. What are the tools of your trade? Curiosity. Research. Imagination. Words. Adobe Creative Suite. Feedback. 8. Who is getting it right in your industry? Those who keep their ear on the pulse of the flux.9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. I think in general, we need to listen to what is being said by our audiences and respond accordingly. Sometimes, we get lost in our own little world. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/421958.jpg" alt="Hellocomputer appointments put spotlight on commitment to transformation, empowerment" width="120" height="120">Hellocomputer appointments put spotlight on commitment to transformation, empowermentRecent appointments announced by Hellocomputer have again put the spotlight on the FCB Africa group agencies' commitment to transformation and empowerment...Issued by Hellocomputer 7 Dec 2017Also, we need to be more representative internally to ensure the stories being told are relatable, relevant and not disrespectful. 10.

Where and when do you have your best ideas? Usually after the brainstorm, while I’m doing something completely unrelated. Allowing my ideas to simmer really works for me.13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I’d like to think my Russian/Portuguese accent gets the party started. 14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? I think I’m in between. I have mad respect for it, but only when it’s done right.15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? A ton of notes. All kinds, from ideas to thoughts to poems to essays to songs. Just notes!16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? People relate to people; therefore, your story is relevant, necessary and just as important as the next person’s. The stage is always set. All you have to do is to step up.Simple as that.
