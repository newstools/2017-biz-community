Online GIFs and memes have become the pulse of social media interaction. They’ve become an engaging way of communicating to each other and best of all, they have the ability to brighten anyone’s day. Instead of starting a new thread of social media conversations featuring our GIFs, we wanted to keep it real and chose to join and react to people on Twitter and Facebook’s existing ones. We reacted to them in an authentic and humorous way, giving more reason to love the Bozza network. To bring that to life on social media gives us one clear goal for summer: #MTNBrightSideGIFs was designed to make MTN customers’ social feeds the brightest in South Africa. For people to use the GIFs we needed to have street cred, so we featured the TVC characters doing the Vosho, a hot new local dance move that harnesses and expresses the summertime feeling. In the end, along with Burley Boys and The End Post Production, we created over 130 GIFs, bringing to life the Bright Side on social media, spreading brand love for MTN, and making their customers’ feeds the brightest in South Africa. https://www.mtn.co.za/Pages/Summer-GIFs https://giphy.com/mtnza/
