Oando PLC (one of Africa’s largest integrated energy solutions provider, listed on the Nigeria stock exchange and the JSE) challenged us to communicate this year’s diversity campaign for their networking lounge at Africa Oil Week.The event gathers together leading independents and corporate players worldwide and from across Africa and the upstream industry in oil, and gas, exploration and development.The creative direction flowed from the campaign imagery which emphasized the roots of a tree and communicated the strength and diversity of team. XZIBIT recreated the tree concept in the form of an abstract artwork using rope to form the shape and structure of the piece.  The base of the tree was knotted to resemble the campaign graphics with the corporate pantones amongst the natural colour.Freestanding walls served as boundaries as well as backlit graphic spaces for messaging and other imagery. The furniture selectionprovided a vibrant feel to the delegate seating area. Guests enjoyed a cup of coffee and the opportunity to charge devices, take a break and network of course.No event is complete without the people on the ground and we are pleased to say that our clients provided a warm, friendly environment for their guests during the event.
