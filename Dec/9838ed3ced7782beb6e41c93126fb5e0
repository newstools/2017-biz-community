He would later take over and transform The Harrow at Little Bedwyn into one of Europe’s finest restaurants. Jones is also a respected wine writer, judge and has recently been announced as the Champagne & Sparkling Wine World Championships ambassador.A few years ago, the regular visitor to the Vineyard Hotel agreed to share his passion and knowledge with other Vineyard patrons by collaborating annually with the hotel’s executive chef Carl van Rooyen on wine-paired dinners.“These dinners are an example of how long-standing friendships based on matching philosophies can bring a showpiece of international acclaim to the shores of South Africa,” says Roy Davies, general manager at the Vineyard Hotel. “Hosting Roger and these dinners is an extension of the Vineyard Hotel’s legacy of combining exceptional wines with exceptional dishes specifically chosen to complement those wines.”SA vs rest of worldThe International Wine Challenge Dinner on Friday, 5 January, pits wines from South Africa against wines from the rest of the world (countries include France, Greece, California , Australia, Germany). Each of the six courses comprising this banquet will be served with an unidentified SA wine, which will be tasted against wines of the same cultivar from another region. Diners indicate their preference after each course, and votes are totalled to determine the winner at the end of the evening.On Tuesday, 9 January, at Roger Jones and the Winemakers, guests can join a more intimate dinner with Jones and the winemakers of South African wines he has chosen to complement another six-course menu. He will discuss the nuances of each wine with the winemakers as well as their personal wine-making philosophy.Jones will also lead a blind tasting of international sparkling wines on Sunday, 7 January - an invitation only event.For more information, go to www.vineyard.co.za.
