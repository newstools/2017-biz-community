Today, the manufacturer leads the local market with many legendary South African vehicles such as the Hilux Bakkie, Rav4, Fortuner, Land Cruiser and the Corolla in its stable.Arguably one of South Africa’s most iconic accounts, the Toyota business was put out to pitch in August 2017 as part of a business-wide process to review all major suppliers to align with procurement requirements, as well as broader transformation goals. Toyota SVP Sales & Marketing, Calvyn Hamman, broke the news today (Friday, 15 December 2017) that it had decided to continue its relationship with FCB Africa.“Our relationship with FCB Africa has always been exceptionally good, and one that has always been regularly measured,” he said. “During this most recent review, we had the opportunity to evaluate and benchmark the cream of the industry, and we elected to remain with the best.”For FCB Africa Group CEO Brett Morris and the more than 30-people strong team the group currently employs to look after the account, the renewal of the contract validated the time, experience and loyalty they have invested in Brand Toyota.“We know that we have created advertising that has deeply resonated with South Africans and helped build Toyota into one of the country’s most loved, and successful, brands. But we also know that we did so as part of a bigger, well-oiled and professional team.  “This is one of our most important and enduring relationships, and is only possible in the spirit of a true partnership that has seen us – as agency and people – grow along with the Toyota business in South Africa. “A huge thank you to the current Toyota and FCB team as well as the hundreds more who have worked on the business for the more than half a century Toyota has been with us. We’re obviously more than delighted that the partnership continues uninterrupted, and look forward to the next chapter.”
