“We have built Avatar on the premise that, to be respected internationally, we need to be preferred locally,” says CCO Veli Ngubane. “We were lucky enough to bring on internationally awarded ECD, Brett Wild, earlier this year, and now we have Grant, who, as joint ECD, will help drive Avatar forward creatively.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422921.jpg" alt="Avatar joint ECDs Brett Wild and Grant Sithole." width="625" height="417">Avatar joint ECDs Brett Wild and Grant Sithole.Sithole says he chose Avatar, over potentially joining an established global agency, because it felt right. “Veli and Zibusiso [Mkhwanazi] have done a great job of laying down an inspiring foundation that’s hard to not want to be a part of. The timing is right. I spent the majority of my life at a big agency [FCB Africa] and this is an opportunity to grow with an agency group of the future.”Here, he shares more about the contribution he hopes to make to the ad world while there and what he’s most looking forward to in the new year… <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1701/375943-120x120.jpg?2" alt="AVATAR cofounders Zibusiso Mkhwanazi and Veli Ngubane" width="120" height="120">Avatar and M&C Saatchi Abel mark SA agency landscape's first share swopToday, Avatar and M&C Saatchi Abel have announced a share deal that will see each of the agencies acquire a minority stake in each other's operations.

I respect the contribution Brett has made both locally and internationally. I love the new positioning of ‘ideas that move people’ that the guys have been driving. He only joined in May this year, so together we will be driving this vision and work, and hopefully contribute to the greater creative community in South Africa together. 2018 promises to be dope. I’m also drawn to the ‘great’ ambition of a local home-grown agency going global. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1705/394139-120x120.jpg?1" alt="Brett Wild, Avatar's new ECD." width="120" height="120">#Newsmaker: On the Wild side with Avatar's newly-appointed ECDBrett Wild was appointed Avatar's executive creative director “just the other day” and just in time as the integrated agency eyes further expansion...By Jessica Tennant 29 May 2017.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you hope to contribute to the ad world, while at Avatar?I love how Veli speaks about trading on excellence and authenticity, two things close to my heart. That, coupled with giving ourselves permission to be fantastical and weird. I hope to drive this conversation wholeheartedly and I feel that the SA ad world has been ready.  .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about being a creative/your career?Invention.

Which brand have you enjoyed working on most, and why? And/or which piece of work are you most proud of and why?This is a tough one because I’m proud of different pieces of work and my relationships with some of the country’s most-loved brands for different reasons.

And/or where do you draw your inspiration from?At any given time, I’m reading about all types of things simultaneously. Right now, I’m still trying give Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman a chance, The Quiet Violence of Dreams by K. Sello Duiker (for the 50th time) and IQ by Joe Ide. I listen to most music but the R&B is strong within me, so I’m always on 112, Jagged Edge, Luther and some of the newer stuff that doesn’t quite fall into the classic definition of the genre, like Jesse Boykins and Travis Scott.

What is your view on agencies participating in award shows?I always say that awards are to advertising what Haute Couture is to fashion. Just because you’ve seen a dress made out of condoms on the runway doesn’t mean we are all going to start wearing grape-flavoured latex to meetings.The design excellence that comes from that space has an influence on what the polyester dresses you see at your local store will look like. The advertising/design/communication work we see in those highly competitive spaces only makes us better. Of course, like with anything, there are some people who have what might look like an unhealthy relationship with awards, but that doesn’t make the awards the enemy. Each to their own I guess.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/421650-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Do award shows really matter?" width="120" height="120">Do award shows really matter?On the back of the Publicis Groupe's announcement at Cannes this year that it will be transferring its award show spend to its investment in AI, agencies are increasingly questioning whether participating in award shows really matters.By Jessica Tennant 6 Dec 2017.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What industry trends do you predict for 2018?The idea is not going to go out of fashion.
