Locally sourced materials such as sand render and coral stone cladding will be used in the construction of the villas in a move to honour local tradition. Climate control measures include optimal orientation on the site as well as natural shading and ventilation methods. Villas in phase one are designed with entrances that have an immediate visual connection to the outdoor pool and golf course beyond. Property owners, as well as their spouses and children under 25, are eligible for Zanzibar residence permits, and residence status is valid for as long as buyers remain owners.Prices for the villas in phase one range from $670,000 to $1.7m.
