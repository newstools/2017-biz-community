At Instant Grass International, we’ve been bringing people and brands closer together for nearly 15 years. Everything we do is really a stand in for interacting with people face to face and while our business is set up to do this, many of our clients simply don’t have the time or the processes to do so. For this reason, we place huge importance in our visual storytelling department, whose job it is to bring people to life for our clients in a way that is both believable and emotionally engaging. We do this through high-quality video, which make an enormous difference to our clients in the boardroom and in their organisations.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422802-625x351.jpg" alt="The importance of visual storytelling" width="625" height="351">It is so easy to get caught up in the data of your job in marketing. Data is undeniably important. But sometimes that data can overshadow the real human on the other side of your brand’s interactions. It is the vital difference between a ‘consumer’ and a real person. And while a person is a consumer at least some of the time, the fact remains that they are a human all of the time.Visual storytelling allows our clients to see the person who buys their products – to understand their life, their needs and wants, their drivers and their fears; to see just what it is like to live as they do. This is something that the most accurate, granular data could never show. We have responsibilities to shareholders and bottom lines, for sure, but really the people we work for are those people who buy our brands. If we keep them in our minds as we go about our work and actively design for them (whether it be new product development through or marketing and branding) we can do our best to ensure we are always making the ‘right’ decision, rather than decisions which are simply expedient or designed to appeal to our internal stakeholders.It seems obvious, but having a name and a face to bring to mind when you’re planning marketing initiatives can really make the hugest difference.We love working with clients like Ackermans, who have done such a great job of putting their consumer at the core of their business. We helped them to do this with some really meaningful videos we created for them, following women who shopped there and helping to understand their needs. In fact, Ackermans took this so seriously they flew the ladies from these videos down to their conference in Cape Town to show their appreciation. The best news is that all in all, it was a resounding success. We captured the entire thing on video, so we can show you just how important visual storytelling can be.IGI The Power of Visual Storytelling from Instant Grass International on Vimeo.
