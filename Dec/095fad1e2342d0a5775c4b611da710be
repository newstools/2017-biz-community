This certification, the highest level to be achieved under IATA’s New Distribution Capability (NDC) Certification Programme, provides increased transparency and speed of communication, allowing customers access to a wider choice of products and services, enabling them to make more informed buying decisions.Qatar Airways chief commercial officer, Ehab Amin, said: “We want to make it easier for customers to access our growing global network and range of products and services. As choices become more complex, we have to provide ways to access them more simply. That is what NDC is all about for Qatar Airways: improving the experience for our passengers.”This status recognises that Qatar Airways uses the latest version of IATA’s global technology standard.
