This has put them at great risk of making losses as they agree to prices that do not make business sense because they do not want the potatoes to rot.The New Times understands that government officials including the ministers for trade and industry, agriculture and local government met over the pricing issue.The meeting with representatives of Irish potato farmers as well as other stakeholders in the potatoes business took place in Musanze District on 6 December 2017.It resolved to put Irish potato collection centres under the management of farmers' cooperatives instead of private entrepreneurs (Middlemen) for better price regulation.There are about 121 collection centres countrywide, according to Havugimana, who added that more centres will be created as more cooperatives are being formed.Following the meeting, the Minister for Trade and Industry, Vincent Munyeshaka set Rwf140 per kg for farmers at the centres.Set price ceiling ignored by farmersBut reports indicate that the set price ceiling has been ignored by the farmers.Munyeshyaka warned that whoever violates the price ceiling would be fined between Rwf20,000 and Rwf2 million based on laws governing internal trade.The institutions requested to monitor the price ceiling are ministries of local government, trade, agriculture and security organs as well as the districts' leadership.Experts argue that price ceilings are a short-term solution and stakeholders will have to expedite plans to add value to the potatoes and implement the potatoes export strategy.This year, the government signed a multimillion-dollar deal with a Nigerian investor to revamp and develop the country's potato industry and help make Rwanda a key exporter of potato products.Under the deal signed in August with BlackPace Africa Group, the firm will also set up two potato processing plants and boost production activities.The five-year project worth $120 million (Rwf102 billion) involves the building of two potato factories; one in the Kigali Special Economic Zone for frozen French fries and another in Nyabihu District to produce potato products for the export market.The firm targets production capacity of 10 million tonnes of potato by the fifth year of the project.When it starts operations, it will process 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes of potatoes making frozen French fries (at the Kigali Special Industrial Zone-based plant), and potato flakes and crisps (Nyabihu plant) targeting export markets in Africa and the Middle East, according to Olusegun Paul Andrew, the chairman of BlackPace Africa Group.
