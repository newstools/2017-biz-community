As a media owner with a proven track record in unlocking advertising opportunities within the broader landlord environment as well as the non-GLA environment, Mall Ads™ was the logical choice to partner with SA Corporate. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422975.jpg" alt="Mall Ads appointed non-GLA partner service provider for SA Corporate Real Estate Fund" width="233" height="350">Carmen Collison, Retail Asset Manager at SA Corporate, says: “Focusing our non-GLA efforts with partners that can drive growth in this area is paramount. As with anything, a focused approach ensures that we are able to understand the operational dynamics, revenue streams and where the growth opportunities lie within this space. The non-GLA scope is diverse and cuts across all areas of our core business. It is refreshing to partner with a team that sees beyond the traditional scope of non-GLA and we look forward to pioneering new concepts and initiatives that will see our revenue growing in this area.” Mzukisi Deliwe, deputy CEO of PMG, believes the five-year contract will bear significant fruit: “PMG has a credible track record of managing property owners’ rights and associated revenues, having won media rights from PRASA, ACSA, Vukile and Anaprop. Our award-winning team is looking forward to extending its know-how and skill set into the commercial and landlord space, where we will focus on innovating and extracting maximum revenue from the available assets.” <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422976.jpg" alt="Mall Ads appointed non-GLA partner service provider for SA Corporate Real Estate Fund" width="600" height="400">“When considering proposals, Mall Ads™ was found to be the only potential service provider that presented beyond mall media and could fully comprehend the scope of non-GLA revenue generation within the retail property environment,” says Andile Rapiya, Broll National Marketing Manager, SA Corporate Portfolio. Deliwe says Mall Ads™ aims to unlock business opportunities across the group and create additional value for property owners. “It is refreshing to be working with an award-winning property owner and a management company that are keen to innovate the approach to non-GLA management as one of collaboration and teamwork,” he says. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422977.jpg" alt="Mall Ads appointed non-GLA partner service provider for SA Corporate Real Estate Fund" width="600" height="400">Deliwe further stated, “We are excited and honoured to be working with SA Corporate and Broll.
