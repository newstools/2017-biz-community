In this newly-launched collaboration with Global Citizen, the brand aims to grow the impact of Mx. with a more tangible contribution to society. “It was crucial for us to find an organisation that would not only reflect our founder’s vision and philosophy in the most genuine way, but also inspire and mobilize our customer,” asserts Daianara Grullon Amalfitano, senior vice president at Aldo. “After successfully launching our genderless sneaker last summer, we sought to further celebrate the intention and values behind its creation. By extending the purpose of Mx. towards this new campaign, our goal is to elevate what the sneaker stands for and raise awareness for a project that will resonate with our global community, the '#AldoCrew'."Falling under the umbrella of Global Citizen’s 'Education For All' initiative, the 'Give Back, Move Forward' campaign aims to fill critical funding gaps in global education, including supporting the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) to achieve its 2018 replenishment goal of $3.1 billion. Helping to fill their funding gap will positively impact hundreds of million children and youth across 89 countries. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1708/405132-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Aldo acquisition of Camuto Group births new footwear giant" width="120" height="120">Aldo acquisition of Camuto Group births new footwear giantCanadian shoe company Aldo has agreed to acquire the footwear and accessories operations of the Connecticut-based Camuto Group...By Lauren Hartzenberg 4 Aug 2017Through its partnership with Aldo, Global Citizen will also continue to call on world leaders, businesses and multilateral institutions to support the GPE 'Education Cannot Wait' fund.
