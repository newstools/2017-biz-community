The members of the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries also decided two weeks ago to extend their agreement to reduce their production further from April next year until the end of 2018.Because of this further increase in the crude oil price, it is expected that the average international price of gasoline may increase by 16,0 cents per litre in January and the diesel price by 17,7 cents per litre.The daily average R/$ exchange rate that has strengthened to almost R/$13 over the last two weeks is expected to result in a decrease of 23,8 cents per litre in the gasoline price and 24,8 cents per litre in the diesel price.The final price changes will be announced by the Minister of Energy.
