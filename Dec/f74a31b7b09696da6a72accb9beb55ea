She said the murder of journalists was an attack on the fundamental human right to share and receive information and on democracy itself.Mexico has been singled out as the deadliest country as 13 journalists had perished there. Each of them, according to the institute, had been targeted due to work.This year there has also been an increase in the number of women who had died. Last year, four women were killed in the line of duty and this year 10 have died thus far.The Caribbean and Latin America were the deadliest regions. There were fewer deaths in sub-Saharan Africa and none in South Africa. Since 2015, IPI has also included murders that remain under investigation. " TimesLiveSource: Herald via i-Net Bridge.
