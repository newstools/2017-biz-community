We took inspiration from Queen Modjadji (the Rain Queen) and the Balobedu people in Limpopo Province. However, it was important that Joburg Ballet added its own unique touch to the dance. The dance was choreographed and performed by Kitty Phetla, a senior soloist at Joburg Ballet. Previous Bite-Size Ballets used more than one dancer, but for this film we all agreed that Kitty fitted the brief perfectly. TBWA\Hunt Lascaris showed Kitty reference videos of the Balobedu rain dance and briefed her to pull elements from the dance in order to create a truly unique and meaningful dance piece. Her wardrobe and the soundtrack were also inspired by the Balobedu people. The film was shot in a day at Theewaterskloof Dam, which has just dropped to a record 24%. As Cape Town’s biggest reservoir, the near-empty dam was an obvious location choice as it represents ground zero for the Cape water crisis. Director Chloe Coetsee, of Darling Films, wanted to honour the simple beauty of the choreography and the starkness of the Theewaterskloof landscape. The shooting style and edit were thus kept simple and clean, with minimal cutting and cinematic trickery. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422219-625x351.jpg" alt="Bite-Size Ballet performs a rain dance for the Western Cape" width="625" height="351">“The turnaround times on each Bite-size Ballet are intense, and yet the dancers and choreographers just seem to nail it every time. Working with them has made us as a team realise how dynamic and incredibly talented they all are. We really need to treat Joburg Ballet like a national treasure, just like any other South African team,” concludes Jeff Tyser, Creative Group Head, TBWA\Hunt Lascaris. A special mention to Darling Films, who made a logistical nightmare seem like just another day at the office! Post-production was handled by The Ludus and sound engineer David Law, who managed to turn around the edit, grade, online and audio mix in a matter of days. A special thanks to L8 Antique, who hail from the same village as Queen Modjadji, for providing the incredible film score.
