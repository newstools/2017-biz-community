Founded by Andrew Shuttleworth, Rob van Rooyen and Vanessa Pearson, these are three industry entrepreneurs who simply believed in a better way, with their philosophy of being brave proving to be something the entire agency rallies around, as they challenge the status quo with strategic and creative intelligence that integrates neuromarketing principles.As a result, they were named by Scopen global president and CEO César Vacchiano as one of the independent SA agencies most successfully providing services within the region, especially sub-Saharan Africa, as well as strong position among South African marketers in the inaugural 2016 Scopen AgencyScope study.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1704/386608-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Bowie15 © –" width="120" height="120">A view of independent agencies in South AfricaNowadays, as we are gradually coming out of a global recession and economic crisis in which communication agencies have been greatly affected, all agencies of all disciplines have continued to compete ferociously for local clients...By César Vacchiano 4 Apr 2017This year, House of Brave executive MD and cofounder Andrew Shuttleworth was elected to the Association for Communication and Advertising’s (ACA) board of directors for 2017/2018<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1707/401812-120x120.jpg?2" alt="New ACA board members elected" width="120" height="120">ACA announces new boardThe Association for Communication and Advertising (ACA) held its 70th AGM on Wednesday, 5 July 2017, electing its new board of directors for 2017/2018...17 Jul 2017They also sponsored Industry Leader of the Year at #FMAdFocus2017, which went to Robyn de Villiers, chairman and CEO of Burson-Marsteller: Africa.Pearson explains that the agency has sponsored the Industry Leader of the Year for two years in a row, and prior to that, sponsored the New Broom Award as they firmly believe that: We need to highlight, incentivise and recognise those who are making a fundamental difference to the growth, success and creative thinking that drives our industry.Scopen Agency Scope 2017 further highlighted the courage of House of Brave, with the young agency shown to be strongly perceived as innovative and creative around integration; as well as great strength in using research, understanding client’s business, understanding the consumer and senior managers getting involved in the accounts, having good professional team and being innovative.

Not only in terms of channels and the growing demand for fully integrated communications agencies with full-service PR and digital offerings, but also in respect to client expectations for effective delivery and a return on every cent of their ad-spend. HOB has, therefore, become entrenched in this sales-related/results-driven culture and has worked hard at understanding the needs of our clients and how every piece of communication can positively impact their bottom line. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1607/351251-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#MandelaMonth: Big, brave and true storytelling" width="120" height="120">#MandelaMonth: Big, brave and true storytelling#MandelaMonth is all about work that uplifts and business that's aimed at more than just plumping up the business bottom line.

We’re ending with two significant wins, having been awarded the Ascendis Health account, comprising some 40-plus brands; as well as part of the Tiger Brands account, including Perfect Touch, Halls and Roses. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Impressive! Let’s touch on the Scopen AgencyScope results in particular, and what it means to be seen as innovative and creative around that current buzzword, ‘integration’. We are really pleased and proud of our Scopen results. Bearing in mind that HOB is only six years young, to have been featured, prominently, on a list of established agencies making an impact on the advertising and communications landscape, is quite an accolade. At Brave, we believe that great ideas are never born out of isolation, but integration.With the rapid evolution of technology and the fast-changing pace at which the world, and in turn, advertising, is advancing, agencies cannot afford not to be at the forefront of innovation if they are to continue delivering effective communication that grows their business. It is, therefore, a great honour to have been highlighted and recognised in the Scopen report as an innovative agency that delivers creative thinking for our clients. And it is precisely this integration of strategic innovation and creativity that will continue driving our business forward in the future. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Explain your first-rate strategic planning and digital effectiveness in particular. Great ideas can only be born out of an understanding of the market, our clients’ business, their needs and a truly strategic approach that delivers ROI; in which the ‘I’ stands for investment, insight, ideas and innovation. Our strategic tools and processes are built around creating effectiveness across every touchpoint with our consumers. At the end of the day, if our creative big ideas do not translate into real returns, our work has failed.In light of this, our strategic hub, led by Rob van Rooyen, focuses on integrating neuromarketing techniques to ensure that when consumers receive information, they interpret it in a way that achieves positive results for our clients.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1702/380449-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Sergey Nivens © –" width="120" height="120">Is your brain doing what you think it's doing?I'm never quite sure what to expect at conferences and seminars.

Talent and tools are the two things we sell. It’s the dynamic infusion of these that gives life to ideas; ideas that make a difference to people’s lives and our clients’ bottom lines.  We continually need to review our strategic and marketing tools, alongside our talent pool, to ensure that our work is up there with the best and delivers the ideal results for growing both our clients’ businesses as well as our own. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}There’s no doubt your agency has made its mark on the local landscape. Talk us through your aims for the coming year. While we are very young, we’re driven by competing with the best, and when we pitch, we pride ourselves on the fact that we’re going head to head with big network agencies or those who have been around for longer than 10 years. This is a testament to both the type of talent and clients we have been able to attract to House of Brave. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1707/400082-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Glickman and twins." width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...
