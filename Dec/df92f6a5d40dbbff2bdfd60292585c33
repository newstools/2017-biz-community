As threats from crop diseases, harsh weather patterns, demography trends increase, a section of legislators who are in agriculture committees said governments need to explore biotech to avert a food crisis.RegulationNational regulatory agencies do not dispute the benefits of GM technology but said clearer and stronger regulatory mechanisms are needed to ensure safe application of the technology.Patrick Karangwa, the head of research at the Rwanda Agriculture Board told Rwanda Today that the country had started the process of putting in place the biosafety standards with a draft law currently being examined by the Rwanda Environment Management Authority. With no specific timelines, the country wants a well-established framework for regulating the transfer, handling, use and release of genetically modified organisms.Concerned institutions said they are particularly interested in having a system for dealing with GM in trade, especially the transboundary movement of living modified organisms. This has to do with controlling how the seeds are developed and where they come.
