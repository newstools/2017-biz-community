The bureau also organised and hosted four site inspections. All of the hosting was done prior to the bid being awarded, which meant the site inspection was an important determining factor as to whether or not a destination is fit to and able to accommodate the bid requirements.  “On behalf of the team, I would like to thank the South African National Convention Bureau for their support. It would not be possible to land these important conferences without their contribution and help. And of course, the industry itself deserves a special mention. They remain the backbone of the business tourism sector in the Cape,” said Judy Lain, chief marketing officer at Wesgro.Combined with the results from the first and second quarter (April-October 2017), the Cape Town and the Western Cape’s Convention Bureau (a division of Wesgro) has secured 18 new bids with an estimated economic impact of R157m for the destination.
