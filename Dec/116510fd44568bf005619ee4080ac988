Each business has its own unique focus; Fairafric produces bean to bar chocolate on site in Ghana, Little Pine Tree teaches unemployed women in Johannesburg how to knit amigurumi toys and The Katy Valentine Collection is a collection of modern African jewellery. When selling their products in Europe, Codonyer says Door to Europe carefully considers which European markets will best respond to their partner’s product. “For example, Fairafric’s chocolate is already well established in Germany, so we have brought their chocolate to Barcelona and will expand into other European markets from there."Europeans have a great appreciation for high-quality African products and there is currently a niche in the European market for African businesses. By filling this gap in the market and establishing themselves outside of Africa, entrepreneurs can diversify their business and give their business the best chance possible of seeing well beyond its first five years.”
