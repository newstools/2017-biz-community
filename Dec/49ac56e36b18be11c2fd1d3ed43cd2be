Doing so also helps organisations minimise the risk of taking temporary staff on board and allows them to take full advantage of the opportunities that this type of employment solution offers.Additional benefits of using labour brokers for temporary staffing requirements include:ExpertiseSmall organisations rarely have extensive human resource departments with the requisite knowledge, time and processes to handle temporary staffing requirements. Smart organisations partner with appropriate service providers to acquire the supplementary workforce needed and to take care of all the admin and payroll duties that go along with it. Kempston Employment Solutions, for example, provides a professional end-to-end solution for the entire Human Resources process, from planning and recruitment, through to vetting and staff management for the duration of the need.Cost savingsOver and above eliminating the hassle of businesses having to recruit temporary staff themselves, using a staffing company is a more cost-effective option, as recruiting, screening and hiring a candidate requires a lot of time and money. Delegating these tasks to an expert will reduce the amount of time and expenses spent on the hiring process. Employing a staffing agency will also allow faster recruitment of temporary staff and reduced downtime. Furthermore, some labour brokers offer tailor-made services to suit specific client needs.Top talent poolLabour brokers have a vast number of skilled and trained candidates - ranging from labourers to specialists - already on hand or on reserve to fill vacancies. Plus, with larger agencies like Kempston Employment Solutions having a presence in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban and Johannesburg, talent can be sourced from and placed across the country.Risk reductionLabour brokers reduce the risks associated with temporary staffing because they vet their hires thoroughly, are experienced in labour relations and have in-depth knowledge of the Labour Relations Act, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and Bargaining Councils. This ensures that clients are protected against the risk of industrial action.FlexibilityThe ability to ramp up employment during peak times and reduce staffing when no longer required - without having to undergo layoffs – will allow organisations to adapt to the South African business climate in 2018. Plus, with some agencies employing staff on a permanent basis, clients won’t have to worry about paying out staff in the event of retrenchment, for example.Labour brokers can equip businesses with the right people who have the right skills at the right time to suit their business needs, whatever 2018 may bring.
