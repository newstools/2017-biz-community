The draft rules would only apply to SSEGs with the installed capacity of no more than 1 MW connected to the national grid as referred to in sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the Notice. The SSEG rules will mainly focus on the registration and connection process, tariff structures and reporting requirements,” said Nersa.Meanwhile, the regulatory rules for small-scale embedded generation will be published after stakeholders have been consulted and Nersa has made its decision.Applications for the registration of SSEGs would only be considered after the publication of the rules.“NERSA will also start the process to develop regulatory rules for the registration of all other categories of facilities referred to in the Notice in due course,” it said.The gazette can be accessed here.
