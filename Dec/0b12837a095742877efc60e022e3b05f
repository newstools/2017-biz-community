In local currencies, sales fell by 2%. On Friday morning, the company's share price plunged by 15% in the Stockholm Stock Exchange."In order to respond even quicker to customers' fast-changing behaviour the company's ongoing transformation journey is being accelerated," Persson said."This includes continued integration of the physical and digital stores, and intensifying the optimisation of the H&M brand's store portfolio - leading to more store closures and fewer openings," he added.The group did not specify exactly how many stores would be closed and where. H&M had announced earlier this year that it would open physical stores around the world to compensate for the downturn due to fierce competition from online sales platforms. H&M group, which owns other popular brands such as COS, Monki and Weekday, has 4,553 physical stores around the world as of 31 August.Source: AFP
