Brands with technologies and solutions that can help the Chinese community will be in a great position to make their mark on a sector that is growing exponentially. “Domestic Chinese brands as well as major international names have signed up, and will find the show useful, no matter if they are trying to source local suppliers, add a creative angle to their packaging, or better understand the latest industry challenges.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423885-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Aerosol, dispensing, beauty packaging leaders to gather at ADF&amp;PCD in March" width="625" height="325">©fiphoto via 123RFPentawards ConferenceBrands and design agencies have been quick to register for the Shanghai show with news of The Pentawards Conference taking place in China for the first time.
