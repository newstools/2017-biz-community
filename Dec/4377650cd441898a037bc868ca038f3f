<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422586.jpg" alt="Stockton Roll-Up Carrier" width="625" height="359">Stockton Roll-Up CarrierLaunched last year, Konnect curates local design collaborations across multiple platforms and disciplines. The designers and partners involved have been invited to join the platform for their creativity and shared ethos of design being something that should not only add aesthetic value, but have functional purpose too. Through Konnect, they have come together to create once-off, limited edition everyday pieces that are unique to the label.Pieces under the Konnect label include a range of ceramics by Munnike, scatter cushions and coasters from Muse Collective, chairs and barstools by North Ltd and a Gin Table from Blok’s interiors coordinator Holly Hamlyn. A variety of other items found in the Konnect range come from the likes of Pierre Cronje, Pezula Interiors, Skinny La Minx, Dark Horse, Mat Neilson and others.Dark Horse approachDescribing the approach taken by Dark Horse in furnishing the apartment, Jarrad Nelson, the brand and design studio’s co-founder says: “We wanted to keep the space incredibly light and open and rather play with bold contrasts between various elements so that it wouldn’t feel overcrowded. In all the furniture, the tones are neutral and we have selected specific colours that have been picked up in the artworks as well as in one or two luxurious accents like the rugs. It doesn’t overly layer the apartment, but gives it enough depth so that you feel that you are walking into something that is very well considered, but not unnatural or obtrusive.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422587.jpg" alt="Stockton Table Setting" width="625" height="417">Stockton Table Setting“The Konnect platform shows that South Africa has amazing talent in design, interiors and property who are working together to create something truly dynamic and world class. It also shows the rest of South Africa that we have great talent available here in Cape Town,” said Nelson.Munnike ceramicsMunnike’s moody ceramics, handcrafted from pitch black clay, are also part of the Konnect selection. The tactile manipulations of earthy mud are made to be used and passed down as heirlooms.The ceramicist, Munnike Geldenhuys, says: “I really love making things that are simple and easy to use, but that are also very beautiful. I don’t think form and function need to be mutually exclusive. With this range, I wanted to create hardworking vessels with multiple functions, that at the same time could easily sit around being sexy and content, without needing anything to hold.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422588.jpg" alt="Munnike Ceramics" width="625" height="417">Munnike Ceramics“The ceramic process as a whole has become invaluable to me. It is my greatest teacher. It has taught me patience, detachment and to be gentle. It has reintroduced me to the importance of play and it continually reminds me that striving for perfection is simply ludicrous, as it does not actually exist," said Geldenhuys when asked about her passion for making ceramics. "The beauty of imperfection is something I meditate on daily and I love seeing it come through in my work. To me, there is nothing more visceral than clay, but to be totally honest, I also just like to get dirty.”“I want people to enjoy my pieces in their homes and to enjoy the fact that art can be accessible, beautiful and multi-functional, all at the same time,” she said.
