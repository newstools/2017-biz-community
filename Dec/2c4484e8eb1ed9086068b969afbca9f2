The championship is credited with introducing the highest standards of racing to the Middle East as proven again today. For Hack, the strength of the weekend’s results including a sixth place in his first ever race at the Dubai Autodrome signal positive sign of progress in this his debut season.

I have to remember that these things do not come overnight and although I am getting used to the car more and more and I feel that I am improving with every race. I also must not forget that in racing anything can happen. There are so many quick drivers out there, and there are also drivers like Magnus Oehman who are almost impossible to pass as their defending is so strong. “I have a lot to work on but I take confidence from knowing the Dubai Autodrome now. With the next round being back here again in the new year, I have high hopes of finishing in a strong position. I’m already looking forward to it.”  Victory by Oliphant in the second race of the weekend came by the tightest of margins. A mere 0.707 seconds separated Oliphant from regional hero Al Zubair following a colossal duel over 14 intense laps. It was the sweet revenge and a reversal of the previous day’s result. But it was never comfortable for Oliphant. He was forced to defend throughout as Al Zubair charged in the closing laps yet he held on for a cherished triumph. The win for Oliphant is his second victory in the opening four races of the twelve race championships and extends his lead in the drivers’ standings to six points over Al Zubair. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/421496-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Alfa Romeo to join Formula 1 again in 2018" width="120" height="120">Alfa Romeo to join Formula 1 again in 2018After more than 30 years' absence from Formula 1, Alfa Romeo is returning to the sport in 2018...5 Dec 2017The historic 100th race has come courtesy of staging nine consecutive seasons and featured an international grid of 17 elite drivers from nine countries, including Germany, Great Britain, Netherlands, Sweden alongside local stars from Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia.
