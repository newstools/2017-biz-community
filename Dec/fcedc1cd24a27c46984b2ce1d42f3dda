"Overall there is a downturn in bookings," Tshivhengwa said. "Whether it's Durban or Cape Town, it's neither here nor there. We are seeing less travel across the board and fewer bookings for these holidays."The 2016 Domestic Tourism Survey released by Stats SA in September confirmed the decline in local travel. It showed that considerably fewer South Africans were taking day or overnight trips and that domestic tourism spend decreased from R110bn in 2014 to about R86bn in 2015 and 2016.Tshivhengwa said the main reason for the decline was the struggling economy and that people were having to carefully "pick and choose" when and where to travel. "Because of the current economic situation customers are sort of depressed and that's playing a role on whether they should go on holiday," he said.The drought in Cape Town, which attracts about 250,000 domestic tourists in December, will not have a big effect on local tourists. Enver Duminy, CEO of Cape Town Tourism, said the 300,000 Capetonians who are estimated to leave the city at the same time would offset the influx.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/419517-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cape Town can continue to welcome international and local travellers despite water crisis" width="120" height="120">Cape Town can continue to welcome international and local travellers despite water crisis"During December, approximately 250,000 domestic tourists travel to Cape Town, but our data shows that around 290,000 Capetonians leave the city..."21 Nov 2017"These estimates illustrate that the influx of visitors should not have a negative effect on water consumption, particularly if visitors adhere to recommended water savings initiatives," Duminy said.Source: The Times
