The Jobs Fund grant will also unlock great operational efficiency and scale that CiTiX will leverage. Recruitment has already started and the programme will launch late January 2018.  Students will obtain industry-relevant technical training in software programming and ICT infrastructure, and will also be trained in one of five key skills streams: Operations Technology, Cybersecurity, Fintech, Geomatics and Artificial Intelligence. The programme will equip them to support and manage products and services in Agritech, Marinetech, Fintech, and Cybersecurity, to name a few.CiTiX – Futured by BCX, will take unemployed, previously disadvantaged South African youth through an intensive and holistic career-readiness pathway, equipping them with the technical and interpersonal skills needed for success in the knowledge economy. Acting as a bridge between education and employment, the programme design ensures graduates are fully supported and experienced to immediately add value on hire. The programme forms part of an arsenal of digital transformation initiatives BCX has co-created. Also to launch in the new year is the Explore Data Science Academy at the Woodstock Bandwidth Barn, which BCX is supporting to grow data analytics capability. BCX is also growth sponsor for WethinkCode, a coding academy through which it funds over 400 learners.
