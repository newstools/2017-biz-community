Pick n Pay and its partners in the programme upgrade spaza stores to meet the needs of customers and communities, helping to grow a new generation of modern retail entrepreneurs. It is a collaborative effort between Pick n Pay, the Old Mutual Foundation, Masisizane Fund, Brimstone, the Western Cape Department of Economic Development and Tourism and the City of Cape Town.Training unlocks opportunitiesLiwani’s expanded staff complement has received training in IT systems, customer service, hygiene and more traditional retailing skills like baking and butchery that open fresh opportunities for each of them. Liwani took over Ndwamba when her father died in 1995, when she was just 21, and is excited to take her business to a whole new level. “We were thinking of how to expand when Pick n Pay approached us, and this is the fulfilment of a dream. We’ll be the only branded supermarket in Nyanga,” she says.Pick n Pay has worked with its suppliers to kit out Ndwamba with new refrigeration and IT systems and it will stock more than 1,000 lines of edible and non-edible groceries, fresh produce and perishables. Services like money transfer, ticketing, airtime and data, bill payments, lottery tickets and prepaid electricity add to the convenience. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1710/415804-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nozinga Market launch begins Western Cape expansion of spaza modernisation programme" width="120" height="120">Nozinga Market launch begins Western Cape expansion of spaza modernisation programmePick n Pay has expanded its partnership programme with independent spaza store owners to the Western Cape...24 Oct 2017The opening of Ndwamba is part of phase two of the spaza modernisation programme, following the highly successful pilot phase in Gauteng last year.
