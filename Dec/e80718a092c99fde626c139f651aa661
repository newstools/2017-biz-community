This constituted 68% of its portfolio, or R43bn (£2.4bn).The share price was, however, hit by Brexit creating uncertainty about the possibly bubble-like nature of rising property prices in central London. Capco plunged 51.71% in 2016 and is off 2.97% so far in 2017. It continues to trade at a discount to net asset value of about 25%.Grindrod chief investment officer Ian Anderson said that while many market participants, including Grindrod, were steering clear of the stock at the moment, the business case remained solid, and the acquisition would help cement Capco’s position as the primary landlord in Covent Garden.Covent Garden remained in a prime position in London, said Anderson, and as further asset deals went through some of the risk being priced into property shares due to Brexit might begin to unwind a little.Lesiba Ledwaba, head of Ashburton Investments property portfolio said that in relation to Capco’s portfolio size, the deal was not material."The Covent Garden assets’ investment case remains intact and any further value enhancing acquisitions or developments are welcome."Capco has sought to reposition Covent Garden as a premier shopping and entertainment destination. Capco’s share price was 0.38% up at R48.10 at close of trade on Thursday.Source: Business Day
