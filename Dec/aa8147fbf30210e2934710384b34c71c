The first drinking water generated by the desalination plant is expected to be fed into the reticulation system by March 2018 with the second phase of five million litres to follow on after a further nine weeks."The plant is intended to operate for a period of two years, based on a service agreement in which the city has agreed to buy water from the service provider Water Solutions Proxa JV. The value of the tenders for the establishment and operation of the desalination plant at Monwabisi for a period of 24 months is R260m," said the city’s mayoral committee member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services; and Energy, Councillor Xanthea Limberg.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423012.jpg" alt="CT begins site prep for Monwabisi desalination plant" width="625" height="417">Other projectsOther projects include the Strandfontein, V&A Waterfront, and the Cape Town Harbour desalination plants; the Atlantis and Cape Flats Aquifer projects; and the Zandvliet water recycling project which will collectively produce an additional 196 million litres per day between February and July 2018. In addition, the city has 12 projects at an advanced planning stage."There will be minimal risks to public health and safety, and work will comply with the applicable national health and safety regulations. All construction areas will be clearly demarcated and will be off-limits to the public. Any pipe work that is not underground will be clearly marked. The plant has been designed to ensure fast-tracked construction and production but with the smallest possible construction footprint."The city will monitor the site and regularly test the drinking water that is produced. We are proud that the plant in Monwabisi will be our flagship desalination plant. We are truly grateful for the support of the community leadership and residents in this area. They will be true partners in this exciting and necessary development," said the city’s mayoral committee member for Area East, Councillor Anda Ntsodo. In addition, the Strandfontein plant site preparation is set to commence which will also produce seven million litres of water per day when in full production. The evaluation of a tender for a temporary desalination plant on East Pier Road in the V&A Waterfront is in its final stages. This plant is to be located in an open-air parking lot opposite the heliports, and will produce two million litres of water per day.
