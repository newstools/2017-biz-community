The retailer says that its animal welfare policies form part of the contractual agreements with its suppliers to which they are obligated to adhere. "In this instance, our supplier purchased trims from a 3rd party based on our synthetic specifications and did not test whether the fibre was synthetic or from animal fur. They are now placing additional emphasis on managing these sourcing processes better," stated Woolworths in a media release."Woolworths is committed to animal welfare. It is our ethical obligation to ensure that the animals in our supply chain are treated in the most humane way possible. On this basis, Woolworths policies state that no animal fur may be used in any of our products. Woolworths takes this responsibility incredibly seriously and has therefore taken the decision to recall these products from the market.""We would like to sincerely apologise to our customers for this disappointing incident. This does not reflect the high standards we have set for ourselves. In light of this incident, we will reinforce our policies governing Animal Welfare to ensure further awareness at all levels and add additional controls and testing to ensure this does not happen again."This incident is related to the three t-shirts, of which 1,276 were sold collectively.Flamingo Tee (503898756) All Sizes (2-9)Lets Roll Tee (503972536) All Sizes (9-15)Milkshake Tee (503916888) All Sizes (9-15)Customers who have purchased these products can return them to Woolworths stores for a full refund.
