A graduate of the School of Visual Arts, Jen worked at Base Design during the early part of her career where she contributed to a number of brand campaigns and fashion identity projects.She is the latest addition to Design Indaba’s speaker roster to take the stage in Cape Town next year. She has become an intellectual figure with a keen sense of why graphic design is perceived as such a vague subject by those who are not professional designers. Known for blurring the lines between curated museum work and retail brand spaces, Jen has collaborated with Nike, the Guggenheim Museum, Puma and MIT Architecture among many other organisations and universities. More recently, she has moved to the high profile start-up realm, having collaborated with Essential Products, IonQ, and Google.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/421047-120x120.png?2" alt="Designers, Azusa Murakami and Alexander Groves.

It's everywhere. It's on your phone, in your email, in your shopping bag. Its power is extremely significant right now in the digital age, specifically in terms of how we communicate," she says.One of Jen’s most notable theories is her unique approach to the term “design thinking”, which she believes has become a lazy blanket term used by folks who don’t engage with creative work critically.
