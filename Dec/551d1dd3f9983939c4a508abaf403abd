This urban grill is also a tasty alternative to similar restaurants like Spur, Dros and Wimpy, that are usually the go-to, mall restaurants when hunger strikes. From “big bun” burgers to "moerse shakes, Brocka delivers by offering a variety of treats suited for the whole family with an added bonus of being Halaal-friendly.Entering the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by the décor. A huge yellow shipping container with the words Brocka written in bright lights above greeted us, which reminded me of trendy food trucks and food markets you usually find at festivals.For the launch, they opted to serve us buffet style – with a selection of burgers, beef ribs, chicken wings and packets of chips waiting to be gobbled up. I picked the Veteran burger (hand-pressed beef with a BBQ sauce) but soon exchanged it for the Mother Clucker burger (crumbed chicken breast burger with avo and mayo) because the saucy burger was just too messy to eat. The chips were crispy and delicious and reminded me of Steers’ legendary chips. However, the wings could have been stickier and I was disappointed that my ribs' meat wasn’t falling off the bone.After the main meal, I indulged in a dessert, the Usual Suspect, which consisted of a waffle trickled with maple syrup, a sliced, lightly grilled banana and toasted ground monkey nuts. I was surprised how much I liked and enjoyed this super sweet treat. Next up was a small Gold Digger shake drizzled with caramel, topped with caramel popcorn and a Flake chocolate. Again, my eyes grew wide in wonder when I tasted the super creamy shake, making a mental note that I’ll definitely be back to taste the rest of the desserts on the menu.Curious about how the idea of Brocka came about, I asked Adeeb Franciscus (Brocka management) to tell me more about what makes the Brocka brand/concept so unique..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Where did the inspiration for Brocka come from and why make it a halaal restaurant?We wanted to deliver an urban food experience within a mall environment. A popular trend around urban street food and markets have become the biggest fad locally. Food trucks, pop-up food markets and farmers' markets have sold the most amazing foodie treats that are generally made from the freshest local ingredients, by hand. Regarding the eatery being Halaal, that was a Canal Walk centre management pre-requisite..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What makes the Brocka brand/concept so unique?We’ve created a menu using fresh local produce and hand-crafted meals to create authenticity.
