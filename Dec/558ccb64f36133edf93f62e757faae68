The company’s localised content strategy focusing on first-run local movies direct from cinema and a bold slate of original programming has shown the largest gains in viewership, with its local and regional offerings and hyper local Originals accounting for a substantial portion of its viewership numbers. To date, iflix has commissioned more than 10 original exclusive projects, including a no-holds-barred stand-up comedy series in Malaysia (Oi! Jaga Mulut); the Phillippines (Hoy! Bibig Mo); and Indonesia (Oi!

The company further announced upgrades to its app performance and functionality, with breakthrough personalisation features and new branded and genre-based Channels, in addition to allowing users to follow celebrity curated Playlists. iflix Group co-founder and CEO, Mark Britt, said: “2017 has been an incredible year for iflix. Surpassing 10 billion minutes streamed in just the last 12 months, is a great way to end a year that saw us launching in MENA and Africa with over a dozen new markets, our first original titles, and so much more.“Every one of these milestones is a testament to the hard work, commitment, energy and passion of our ever-growing team of 700 across the world. We also owe a huge thank you to our customers, for sharing their time, feedback and patience, allowing us to continually learn, and improve and get better every day at delivering a service created just for them.” And to celebrate the 10 billion minutes streamed milestone, iflix is running the We Love Ya campaign across its Facebook pages, to thank fans and subscribers of the service. The campaign, which shares some fun and quirky iflix viewer data, includes a sponsored giveaway of year-long iflix subscriptions to participants in all iflix markets.
