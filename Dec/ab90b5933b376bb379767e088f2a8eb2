Glover says 2017 has been a tough year, and by tough she means "completely crap". "The fact that we’ve still managed to make some beautiful film is a small Christmas miracle. Overall the work was good despite the fact that many of the scripts were not. In fact, the quality of production was far better than the quality of the ideas."In terms of craft, she thought one piece stood head and shoulders above the rest:The ‘No Excuse’ spot for Carling Black Label is flawlessly executed across every craft category. Kim Geldenhuys’ direction is considered but not laboured, Gordon Midgely has stitched together the edit to create a really compelling narrative, and the music, supervised by Marc Algranti, is amazeballs. Yes, I said amazeballs. It’s also worth mentioning that the audio mix is very well handled. It’s no small thing to balance live sound, dialogue and a vocal music track. This piece really demonstrates how interconnected film craft is and why it’s so important to get every aspect right.A special mention also went to Tusker's ‘Light the Way’ by SJ Myeza-Mhlambi from 7Films for Direction Craft.To view all the winners and entries visit iDidThtEditorial.com.Every month iDidTht.com teams up with a top local creative director to award the best in film craft by leading production companies in South Africa.
