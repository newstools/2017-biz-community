RSAWeb is a national internet service provider headquartered in Sea Point. “This project gives tourists the chance to advertise our beautiful city on their social media and, more importantly, it gives any person high-quality internet. The importance of convenient access, especially in underprivileged areas, cannot be understated. This is part of our FreeWifi Project Beta programme before we target other high traffic areas around Cape Town. We welcome public engagement as to where future FreeWifi would be most beneficial to their local community,” Mark added.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422463-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Beware of getting hacked through public Wi-Fi" width="120" height="120">Beware of getting hacked through public Wi-FiAs much as public Wi-Fi is great for convenience - it's free, saves on mobile data, and is often faster when it comes to downloading - hackers love public Wi-Fi too, and for different reasons...5 hours agoSays the Friends of Sea Point Pavilion, a long-standing community group formed in 2009 to help make the swimming pool area more enjoyable and convenient as a public facility: “The Wi-Fi also gives us a way to help support our food vendors already on the forecourt.” The forecourt area alongside the swimming pool is the only area on the promenade with arranged shaded seating where you can enjoy some refreshments, an ice-cream, a coffee, or even lunch, from a nearby food vendor. Up to 50 devices can be connected to the Wi-Fi at the same time.
