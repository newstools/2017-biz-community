However, for only doing half a job this week, I will start off by awarding myself half an Onion. And I will work a lot harder on my grumpiness, I promise … To compensate slightly, there will be two Orchids this week.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422370.jpg" alt="Different Cokes for different folks." width="625" height="665" rel="">Different Cokes for different folks.click to enlargeThis first goes to Coca-Cola for its print ads, which broke this week, and which deal with the tricky issue (for a maker of sweet soft drinks, anyway) of sugar and healthy diets. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1710/416527-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Things go smaller with Coca-Cola" width="120" height="120">Things go smaller with Coca-ColaThe "buddy" Coke size has been reduced to 440ml and there will be no more 500ml bottles on the shelves after next month, as Coca-Cola attempts to cut its customers' sugar consumption...30 Oct 2017Soft drinks with sky-high sugar contents have been fingered as some of the prime culprits in the soaring rate of obesity. And, while soft drink companies have already introduced low-sugar or sugar-free alternatives, they are still trying to fight government efforts to control their industry.This week’s ads have a clever pun: Different Cokes for different folks. That is an opportunity for the company to explain that it is always looking for healthy alternatives, without losing the unique flavours of its products. It’s simple and it’s clever and it’s tactical, and it does the job. So it gets an Orchid.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/417711-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Sreengrab from the ad." width="120" height="120">#OrchidsandOnions: It's going to be a retina-searing summer with Cell C... but there's cynical misdirection from Coca-ColaIt's that time of year again: summer is here, so can the cellphone network ads be far behind?By Brendan Seery 7 Nov 2017However, I can’t help but remember, as I noted a few weeks ago, that the company’s reduction in the size of its containers seemed to be more about profit than health considerations, no matter what they said at the time.The Western Cape government has already got a few Orchids from me for its road safety campaigns, executed by FCB Cape Town under the banner of “Safely Home”.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1708/406641.jpg" alt="FCB Cape Town creates dramatic new #SafelyHome commercial" width="120" height="120">FCB Cape Town creates dramatic new #SafelyHome commercialSafely Home, the Western Cape Government's Department of Transport & Public Works' road safety campaign, has released a new hard-hitting TV commercial created by FCB Cape Town and Egg Films...Issued by FCB Africa 17 Aug 2017The latest is timed and angled to coincide with the 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children. FCB says the ad is intended to show the similarity between violence towards women and children and aggressive driving. So we see a woman who, at first, appears to be a victim of domestic violence. Her words reinforce that impression.“Something inside him just snaps. He won’t listen to reason… I just have to sit there and take it…” And then: “But this time, he totally lost control…”She has a battered and bruised face and her tears flow.She then explains that she was told that if he was driving any faster, she would not have survived. It becomes clear that we are looking at an accident survivor.However, the kicker lines which follow emphasise: “There are many forms of abuse; aggressive driving is one of them.”Then, comes the slogan #ManUpSlowDown, which makes the point that being a man is not about driving fast – or hitting women.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422024.jpg" alt="'Man Up, Slow Down'" width="120" height="120">'Man Up, Slow Down'To draw attention to the national 16 Days of Activism campaign, FCB Cape Town has developed another hard-hitting ad for the Western Cape Government's Safely Home initiative...Issued by FCB Africa 7 Dec 2017It’s not pleasant to look at but it hits home. So more Orchids for the Western Cape government and FCB Cape Town.
