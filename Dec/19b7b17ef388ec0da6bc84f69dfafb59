The situation has also been intensified by lesser rainfall in critical catchment areas during the 2017 winter rain season. Without further significant out-of-season rainfall over the summer months – which cannot solely be relied on to recharge the catchment areas – or alternative means of water contributions, even with huge water saving measures being employed, the region will run out of water as forecasted for March and before the 2018 winter rain season.Critical stateWater resources in the Western Cape are in a critical state. However, this cannot be attributed to poorly maintained infrastructure as the condition of reticulation and non-revenue water management in the region is better than the rest of the country and on par with global best standards. It also cannot be assigned to lack of foresight and unexpected changes in the rainfall patterns for the region, as these were forecasted years ago.Simply put, we hoped for rain and took too long to respond. Action should have been taken sooner, not only in terms of driving awareness to save water – and employing water restrictions – but also to invest in alternative supplies of water. Now, and given the state of emergency, the Cape Town City Council is under immense pressure to strictly manage what resources remain.This is not a phenomenon in the Western Cape only, as the region is one of six Mediterranean classified areas across the world that is experiencing huge drought patterns with significantly below-average rainfall. Such drought cycles can last for years, and this will not be the last drought cycle – making steps that are taken now vitally important for securing alternative water sources and resilience, to spare the region from future potential water crises.Alternative water supply projectsCurrent efforts though by the Cape Town City Council must be commended. The council has planned to spend upwards of R3.3bn, investing in urgent alternative water supply projects to remedy the emergency situation and secure resources in the region for the future – though it will take at least a year before the region will feel the difference of these contributions.The ‘new build’ projects under way simultaneously as part of this emergency plan are focused in three possible supply streams, including drilling for ground water, recycling of wastewater and desalination of sea water. Recycling of wastewater and desalination, in particular, offer immense opportunity to secure alternative water resource. For instance, currently only 9% of wastewater is being recycled in Cape Town, specifically, but if we look at a city like Windhoek that is totally run on recycled wastewater – or similarly a city like Dubai that only uses desalinated water – we can recognise the potential to increase the capacities of these alternative water supplies on a much larger scale.Parallel to these new project investments, the council is investigating advance leak and pressure dedication technology, with the aim of improving non-revenue water management even further.Reducing water consumptionHowever, one of the biggest challenges remains to reduce water consumption to as low as possible. For instance, of the 600-megalitres-a-day consumption target, 65% of this water is used by single residential houses, and not by industries or businesses as might be expected. Some single residential houses are recorded to be using more than 20,000 litres of water per month. To address this, the local municipality in Cape Town is also looking at installing 70,000 smart meters, which will provide for more accurate assessment of and control over water usage.The water crisis will continue to have a negative impact on businesses, industries and the general economy of the Western Cape and, as a result, the percentage contributed by the region to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Added to this, because of all the investment into securing alternative water resources for the future, the cost of water in the region will become more expensive – adding costs to business and citizen consumers, alike.We need to accept and appreciate that the road ahead will be a difficult one. That even once the alternative water supplies are on board, it will take some time for the natural and economic ecosystems to make a full recovery. And, to help in preserving water resources and cost-risks to themselves, every business and residential property owner should at the very least be contributing to the effort of reducing water consumption and usage, and investigate off-grid solutions for harvesting rain and grey water on their premises. As we head into a dry summer, every drop spared counts.
