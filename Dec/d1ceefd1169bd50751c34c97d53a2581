Her device is called ICUC or ‘’I can see what you can see’’ and is fitted to trucks so that motorists following behind them can see exactly what the truck driver sees. How it worksShe placed a camera inside the vehicle on the dashboard and fitted a screen to the back of the truck. The camera captured the front view that the truck driver had and transmitted this to the screen at the back, so that motorist behind the truck could see "through" the truck. The hope is that this device will help to prevent unsafe overtaking to prevent accidents.“I made the ICUC to make travelling on South African roads safer and easier and to decrease accidents and fatality rates. The ICUC does not only help prevent car accidents but it also helps drivers to see oncoming cars and animals far in the distance,” Kaka says. About Eskom ExpoKaka’s project was among 600 presented at the Eskom Expo, the country’s most prestigious science fair where every year learners from across the country gather to compete with the hope of taking home a medal or a share of special awards valued at more than R4m. The competition focuses on science, technology, engineering, mathematics and innovation (STEMI) and aims to cultivate a passion for the sciences with the hope of developing a pipeline of talented young scientists.  “This year we saw an impressive array of technology solutions from apps that help learners with spelling and mathematics right through to technical innovations like Samirah’s that use everyday technology to address our most pressing problems,” says Parthy Chetty Eskom Expo executive director.Participants are required to use the basic scientific method, developing a hypothesis and then testing it. Kaka tested the ICUC unit and found that it worked effectively, transmitting the view immediately to the screen at the back of the vehicle. She also tested it to ensure it was visible during the day and at night. “The Eskom Expo is about much more than teaching these budding young scientists the fundamentals of scientific investigation. We want to cultivate a passion for the STEMI subjects, encourage learners to see that science is a way to address some of society’s biggest challenges and we want them to consider careers in the sciences,” Chetty explains.
