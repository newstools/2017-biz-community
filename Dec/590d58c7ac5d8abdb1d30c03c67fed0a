When he released Man On The Line in 1981, De Burgh was a well-established global star and the single from this album High On Emotion became a number one record right across the globe. 1986 saw the release of Into The Light, which sold in excess of 10 million copies worldwide. It also featured the single Lady In Red, which was number one in 50 countries.   By 1990, De Burgh's became the only international artist to personally receive an invitation from then-Chancellor Kohl to perform at the historic public celebrations marking the reunification of East and West Germany. With his 1995 album Beautiful Dreams, De Burgh realised a lifelong ambition to have his music recorded in a classical style with a full 32 piece orchestra. Musically, A Better World is a familiar De Burgh melting pot of diverse styles, tempos and instrumentation. Ballads sit alongside anthems, solo performances with band or orchestral ensemble pieces. Rock and pop songs are infused with regional flavour; from the Caribbean to Celtic. Guitar, bass, drums and keyboards are augmented by pipes, strings and brass. Tickets go will go on sale at 9am on 16 December 2017 from bigconcerts.co.za and Computicket.
