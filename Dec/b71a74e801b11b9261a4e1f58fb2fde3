The average age of those who left was 43.38 years and the average period of service 14.78 years. Of those who left 344 resigned, 83 retired and the services of 40 were terminated.At the end of March 2017, Sars had a total staff complement of 13,583 employees, of whom 3,530 were professionals, 7,730 skilled and junior employees and 1,771 semi-skilled personnel.Sars spokesman Sandile Memela said the focus on the total number of people leaving the organisation gave a skewed picture "as the total attrition also includes seasonal workers, graduates as well as deaths, retirements and dismissals."The Sars attrition rate shows a constant decline over the last four years. The attrition rate [among permanent employees] was 6.01% in 201314 against an attrition rate of 4.08% for 2016-17."In the 2013-14 financial year, 645 permanent employees left SARS, followed in subsequent years by 607 in 2014-15, 452 in 2015-16 and 391 in 2016-17.Total staff exits in 2016-17 were 1,111 of which 934 were resignations. Of these resignations, 528 were because contracts had expired.Memela said resignations in the "audit job family" had remained constant at 52 for each of the past two years and the attrition rate in this section had declined from 6.77% in 2013-14, to 4.37% at the end of the 2017 financial year.But Lees insisted that Gigaba's reply revealed "the sheer extent of the brain drain" at the revenue service."Sars has experienced institutional decay under its commissioner, Tom Moyane, and the reply confirms this. It also indicates the likelihood of continued institutional weakening," Lees said.Source: Business Day
