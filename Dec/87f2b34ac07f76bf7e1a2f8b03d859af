Production, however, is not set to start until 2019, with the first deliveries slated for 2020.Volkswagen, Nikola and Einride are also among the pioneers in developing electric truck prototypes, some equipped with autonomous driving functions and futuristic designs.Daimler did not disclose the price of its eCanter, but said the vehicle offered "savings up to â‚¬1,000 per 10,000 kilometres on operating costs" in comparison with conventional trucks.Models destined for European and US clients will be produced in Tramagal, Portugal.Source: AFP
