New supporters can also download, sign up and give back without filling in any paper forms or waiting for their card in the post. The app allows users to set up a personal profile and search for causes, and select or change them instantly. Feedback stories and videos are available via the app so that supporters can see the difference that they make. Supporters can also access exclusive vouchers and offers immediately via their phones. Theyâ€™ll also be able to find local partner stores in their area from the more than 1500 partner stores.  To transition to card-free giving, existing supporters need to download the app and log in with their current details. The app also links to Woolies cards.    MySchool MyVillage MyPlanet has partnered with the technology consulting company Datonomy Solutions for the development and implementation of the app.  The latest version 1.0.5 offers the new virtual card plus in-app notifications and functional enhancements.
