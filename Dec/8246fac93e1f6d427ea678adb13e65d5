Kwagga Plaza will get a complete facelift. Old face brick facades will feature steel cladding and continuous shopfronts, creating a thoroughly modern feel. Three new entrances will be built, as will water tanks and a new sewerage plant.The taxi rank is being repositioned and food outlets are being concentrated in a food court. Additional parking has been created as a result of breaking down a number of blocks. “Over the years, a number of extra blocks were added to the plaza at various levels. Added to this, the site has a large fall, which turned out to be quite a design challenge,” said Pretorius.
