Or those in the exhibition business are not doing enough to convince visitors to attend.For a start-up business, it can be challenging to commit to a three-day exhibition if the key staff running the business have to be out of the office to showcase at the exhibition. Another reason why the size of the exhibition has shrunk in the last few years could be due to newer, emerging advertising platforms such as online and digital platforms, making traditional exhibitions as dying form of advertising.  Mobile technologyA growing trend that I have observed in exhibitions, is that businesses exhibiting have heightened their use of technology on their stands, the use of the stand space is smarter, HD and has virtual reality elements. In order for brands to have a heightened experience with their customers, the use of smart technology also makes a lot of sense, where the visitors can download or access online platforms where they can try products or access information about a product or services in real time. In short, technology will continue to drive the world of commercial exhibitions.The potential customers (visitors) engages on a digital interface than your traditional brochures and leaflets. Customers can have a virtual experience with a brand. No one really wants to go a lifeless shell scheme with poor lighting and a few magazines. With the right use of content, colour, branding, any company can master their ability to showcase their business. Adam Dembovsky, the CEO of Innovation Factory, says, “Exhibition stands are no longer just a one-dimensional platform to sell your brand. In order to get people out of the aisles and into the booth, strive to create a memorable experience. Exhibitions are theatre; you’re putting on a show.Rob McPherson, key accounts manager at M&M Expo adds to say, the visual appeal of a stand is what attract visitors to the stand at the end of the day. 1. Market research – Marketers must think carefully whether to exhibit or not and plan strategically if decide to do so. You can do a search of the biggest shows for 2018 in your industry here.2. Target audience and objectives – Ensure that you target the right shows in your industry. Do your research in advance, ask the exhibitors for a floor plan to see who has signed up from your industry. Just because everyone is there, does not necessarily translate that you have to be there. Is it aligned with your business goals?3. Sponsorship and promotional marketing – Consider the correct sponsorship if brand awareness is what you are after. For example, you could sponsor the lanyards for the name badges for the entire show.4. Activity – Set up multiple meetings with potential clients at your stand to get them to attend. Find ways to have activity at your stand throughout the show. Use food, and snacks to attract visitors. Rotate key staff who are key advisers or experts on the products or services you will be exhibiting.5. Cross selling – If the exhibition is tied to a conference, it would be a great idea to have presence as a guest speaker. Follow up on any potential business or connections you made at the show, which will be great motivation to the CEO for your next marketing budget.
