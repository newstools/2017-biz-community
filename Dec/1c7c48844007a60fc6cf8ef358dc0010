Rossiter, Eales and McPherson on the red carpet at Loeries 2017.Eales, Rossiter and McPherson with their 2017 Loeries wins.Publicis Machine’s group executive creative director Gareth McPherson, in the role since the agency’s outset almost six years ago, statesAdvertising agencies are no longer in the business of advertising – at least, they shouldn’t be, if they want to survive. Instead, as a partner to our clients’ businesses, our job is to provide solutions to their business problems. And with Publicis Machine having taken top taken the top creative spot among the Publicis Africa Group network in 2016, it’s just that ethos that led to further strategic growth for the agency and a plethora of awards celebrating that creativity in 2017.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1707/400187.jpg" alt="Publicis Machine takes Bronze at Cannes for Biral Spiral radio advert" width="120" height="120">Publicis Machine takes Bronze at Cannes for Biral Spiral radio advertLeading South African integrated communications agency Publicis Machine scooped Bronze at the Cannes Lions awards in the Radio category this year for its Biral Spiral advert, "Gym Boy"...Issued by Publicis Machine 5 Jul 2017Globally, Publicis Machine featured in at the seventh spot of the top 10 SA agencies that featured at Cannes Lions this year, with McPherson likening this to “rubbing shoulders with giants”.Taking that award-winning work ethos Public(is)They also added a few local feathers to their cap, with Publicis Machine MD Wimpie le Roux elected as a member of the Association for Communication and Advertising’s (ACA) board of directors for 2017/2018 and creative director Willie Struwig a member of this year’s Pendoring judging panel for advertising in the vernacular.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1708/406640.jpg" alt="Publicis Machine creates Stones Pool Table BOT - a clever idea and brilliant business solution" width="120" height="120">Publicis Machine creates Stones Pool Table BOT - a clever idea and brilliant business solutionFor too long, advertising agencies have been stuck in an advertising silo, working as a supplier on what can be a long, complicated, and costly chain. Briefs are handed over, ideas are exchanged, advertising campaigns are produced...Issued by Publicis Machine 17 Aug 2017They also brought home ‘brand identity and collateral design - identity programmes’ campaign bronze and ‘digital and interactive - applications, games and interactive tools’ silver for Red Bull Studios Cape Town’s Red Bull Studios Algorhythm with another ‘digital and interactive - applications, games and interactive tools’ silver for the Rayhas Stones Bot at this year’s Loeries. As a result of this outstanding work that goes beyond mere advertising, Publicis Machine featured in this year’s Loeries Rankings at sixth spot on the table for digital and interactive communications, as well as the Creative Circle’s Interim Rankings, which include 2017 results from Cannes, D&AD, One Show and Loeries, at 18th spot for individual agencies and 13th spot for agency groups. I caught up with for McPherson, as well as account director Jamie Rossiter and creative director PJ Eales, who all worked on those Loeries-winning campaigns, to find out how they plan to extend their winning streak next year and which agencies they admire most in the industry… <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423274.jpg" alt="McPherson, Rossiter and Eales." width="625" height="326">McPherson, Rossiter and Eales..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you attribute this year’s successes to? McPherson: We’ve prided ourselves on our creativity over the short five years we have been building the agency. Creativity is at our core, and the clients we have attracted and want to partner with understand that. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1611/369555-120x120.jpg" alt="Publicis Machine takes top creative spot in Publicis Africa Group Network" width="120" height="120">Publicis Machine takes top creative spot in Publicis Africa Group NetworkPublicis Machine has taken the top creative spot among the Publicis Africa Group network this year...22 Nov 2016Going into 2016 we launched a robust strategy on ‘how’ to deliver unique solutions to conventional challenges, and with the rise in technology and digital tools, we knew that providing strong ideas that are fuelled by tech we would achieve this vision. This year's success is proof of that. Rossiter: The marriage of technology and creativity is at the heart of our agency strategy and the work that received recognition this year is proof that this focused approach is working for us. Eales: Technology is moving at an incredible rate and as McPherson said, in order to keep up with this, we made a decision at the beginning of 2016 to change our strategy to deliver solutions to our client’s problems that are driven by a combination of creativity and technology. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What plans are already underway to better your ranking next year? McPherson: The pursuit will always be there. Betterment and refining our product and service. I like to refer to our ethos as ‘never afraid’, as we are never afraid to try something new, groundbreaking or bold… I think by sticking to our strategy and aligning it with our attitude/ethos, we will continue to deliver unique solutions that resonate with our clients’ audiences.Rossiter: We’ll continue to pursue the alchemy of creativity and technology as the formula is not only working, it resonates with each and every one of us in the agency. In our industry, the only constant thing is change, especially in the world of tech, and this excites us – a lot. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1703/386230.jpg" alt="Mastering strategic growth in 2017 with Publicis Machine's Moagi Bodibe" width="120" height="120">Mastering strategic growth in 2017 with Publicis Machine's Moagi BodibePublicis Machine's recently appointed chief strategy officer Moagi Bodibe recommends stopping to pause for thought and ensure your game plan is watertight to get ahead in the coming months...By Leigh Andrews 3 Apr 2017Eales: Now that we’ve seen our strategy start to deliver results, we’ll stick to it and aim to get better year on year, constantly refining our thinking with the same drive to do better, year on year. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How does this year’s Loeries flock differ from your haul last year? McPherson: Let’s just say it’s a 100% improvement. Last year we had a lot of finalists but walked away empty handed… that motivated us to do better and be better. You need to have those reality checks to take stock of where you are at as an agency, and then improve what needs improving.In one year, we went from winning ad of the year, to winning nothing at the Loeries just four short months later. That gave us perspective. I’ve always said it’s not about the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog. This year we proved we are back on the map and improving. Our Loeries wins proved this, so did our Cannes wins.Rossiter: Chalk and cheese! Last year we didn’t convert a single finalist, which was gut-wrenching for all of us. But we didn’t skip a beat, we got up, dusted ourselves off and put our best foot forward, and we chased the work that echoed our strategy. Eales: It’s a 100% improvement. Last year we landed a bunch of finalists but no conversions, it was a bitter disappointment but one that made us reassess the work we’re doing and push harder, with the results speaking for themselves….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us two people you personally admire in the industry – both an established mentor figure as well as a newcomer making waves. McPherson: I’ve always had great respect for all agencies and agency leaders that achieve creative accolades and success. Grid Worldwide and Native VML come to mind. I think the teams and leadership in both those agencies have incredible passion and vision. We are all friends, even though we are competitors. We learn from one another through observation and also friendly engagements. I think this is what pushes the industry forward. Both of them feel that they’re embracing the ‘new’ way of communication and branding."Personally, I’m getting tired of creatives and industry leaders saying that our models and the advertising industry is under threat. I think we all need to stop fuelling the negative spiral of demise and embrace the change. We need to look for new ways to operate, communicate and be profitable." Solving problems is what we do, and at the core of this is our ability to do it creatively. This is what will always drive our success. ‘Be positive and innovate.’ That’s my mantra. We’ve been very fortunate to welcome newcomer and AAA’s Student of the Year, Kelsie Blake, to our team as a permanent member of the Publicis Machine Cape Town team this year. We actually identified her through our robust mentorship and learnership programme. Kelsie really has been a valuable asset to our studio and she comes with a great attitude and abundant willingness. All the ingredients that you can’t teach, and you just know she will grow into a future leader. I’m confident Kelsie will have an incredible career in our industry and will grow into one of the women in power in the industry.  She is definitely one to watch. Rossiter: I’ve always admired Nunu Ntshingila, head of Facebook Africa. Not only is she a formidable business person, but a powerful advocate for women, especially young women, who have the fortitude and dedication to make a career within the communications industry. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1708/405779-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Loeries2017: What the hell happened to women in leadership?

Eales: Pete Khoury, Shane Forbes and the team at TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris are people whom I continue to admire. I love the work they’re doing at the moment and the quirky stuff they’re producing for their clients. I’ve known both of them since the early days at the Jupiter Drawing Room and Metropolitan Republic and I dig that they’ve become such creative powerhouses. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1710/416275.jpg" alt="TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris Johannesburg celebrates the Loeries success" width="120" height="120">TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris Johannesburg celebrates the Loeries successThe 2017 Loerie Awards saw TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris Johannesburg walking away with a handful of awards and accolades, including five gold, one silver, and eleven bronze statues...Issued by TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris 20 Aug 2017As far as newcomers go, I have to big up one of our own newcomers: Kelsie Blake. She was student of the year at AAA last year and we were lucky enough to add her to our team in 2017. She has this incredible new-age way of thinking and looking at things, something that certainly keeps me on my toes when we review. It’s young talents like Kelsie who keep old dogs like me young and fresh.  Lots to look forward to from 2018!
