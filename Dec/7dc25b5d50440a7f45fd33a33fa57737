The founders have executed $1.4bn in real estate transactions overall, with over 1,500 transactions across 46 countries to a value of $380m executed on the blockchain. “Through the Wealth Migrate platform and the WealthE Coin, people worldwide can transact real estate investments in a secure and compliant manner,” said Picken, founder and CEO of Wealth Migrate. “Global real estate investing has previously only been accessible to high net worth individuals and institutions. We’re committed to widening access to investment and portfolio diversification opportunities to everyday investors who wish to access this lucrative market, and to bridging the current inequitous wealth gap.”Wealth Migrate enables anyone, whatever their level of investing expertise, to access global investment opportunities with nominal amounts of fiat money or cryptocurrency. “Our mission is to empower a billion people by 2020,” said Picken. “And the WealthE Coin is the catalyst which is going to allow this to happen!”WealthE Coin is now available in a token presale with the public crowdsale scheduled for 1 February 2018.
