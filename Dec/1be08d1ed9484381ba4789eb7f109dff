The message was a concise and simple way to show how making the smallest effort to donate blood could have quite a significant result for the recipient. It beautifully tapped into the emotions of not only the people who had benefited from blood donations, but also showed immense gratitude towards the blood donors who save lives. We are confident SANBS and WPBTS will see the ROI instantly and include us in their media plans going forward in 2018! The campaign was negotiated by Sarah Chingosho, Business Unit Director | DDB SA directly with Reinhardt Hanel CEO of Oasis Digital Networks.
