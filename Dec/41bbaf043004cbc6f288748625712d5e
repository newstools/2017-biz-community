What made the project even more special for all involved was the fact that two employees from the Italian and Portuguese offices were able to join the Johannesburg team to assist on the makeover. Natércia Rodrigues who travelled from the Portuguese office to assist in the refurbishment said, “Being greeted by the children in the morning as they said, “Good morning teacher” and then seeing their little faces when they saw their new school, were magical ‘money-can’t-buy’ moments that have changed my life forever.”The centre now has two new classrooms and a children’s ablution block. It is definitely a happier and safer environment for the children to learn, play and grow. Funding for the project was secured by TLC’s 14 global offices and was managed by TLC Trust, the CSR division of the business. TLC Marketing’s Chief Operation Officer, Emma Burns, Founder of TLC Trust says, “We are thrilled to have been able to complete this renovation project with the involvement of our entire company. It was a truly global effort that’s given us the drive to make more of a difference wherever we can.”TLC Marketing Worldwide has also pledged to continue to be part of JAM South Africa ‘Nutritional Feeding Programme’ for the third consecutive year. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422694-625x342.jpg" alt="TLC Marketing Worldwide gives some TLC to the Diepsloot Community Loving and Care Centre" width="625" height="342">JAM is a South African founded international humanitarian development organisation. In existence for more than three decades, JAM have provided more than 1,64 billion meals to over a million beneficiaries across Africa.  David Brown, Managing Director of JAM South Africa, says, “Only 23% of preschool children receive adequate nutrition and 26% are stunted as a result of inadequate nutrition, meaning they cannot play and learn, as children should. Only 60% of preschool children have access to Early Childhood Development. We welcome the partnership with TLC Marketing, which allows us to help give these children the nutrition and education they so sorely need. Thank you TLC Marketing! You are helping give children the future they deserve.”
