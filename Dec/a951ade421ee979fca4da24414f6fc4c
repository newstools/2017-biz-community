According to Marco Teixeira, DHL Supply Chain’s automotive director for South Africa, “the time between an order sent into a logistics provider and the load being delivered to its destination, has traditionally been completely “blind” for a transport manager. The industry is now realising that it has to take a more holistic approach to transport and start to implement technology systems that can give transport managers full end-to-end visibility, with as granular detail as possible.” For DHL customers, it’s a value-added service and allows for the creation of additional relevant products. “We can now offer managed transport services, which we weren’t able to do in the past, becoming the trusted transport advisor to our clients who don’t use DHL vehicles.”  For businesses that do not have a transport division or the technology to manage it, DHL is now able to assist with advising on, planning, execution and reporting of the customer’s fleet.Teixeira adds: “By using our Central Control Tower, clients are able to track their own vehicles or third party vehicles, giving them planning, tracking and reporting services. Ultimately, it’s all about creating efficiencies, which in turn lowers the supply chain cost for customers.”
