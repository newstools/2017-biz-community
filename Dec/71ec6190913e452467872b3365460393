January: The year started with sport euphoria #ProteaFire, only for big exits from the team to dampen our spirits, another fire raged, this time in the Cape, Hlaudi #Motsoeneng was on everyone’s radar, #ShiraazMohammed became a household name and the #WeAreANC’s 105th birthday campaign failed dismally.  PR disaster and another big fire topped the charts, Ford Kuga. Abroad we saw Trump’s inauguration and US protests. We also mourned the loss of #GeorgeMichael #Stuff2017February: This month brought more politics with #SONA, #Molefe being sworn into parliament and we held our breath as rumours were abound of #PravinGordhan’s axing. #Xenophobia made a big re-entry.  Internationally Trump’s valentines gift to America was a wall and a ban on Muslims leaving international media shaking their heads. The Scots announced a referendum and London came under terrorist attack. #Stuff2017March: #SASSA left us breathless as millions waited for their grants, but they weren’t the only SOE - PRASA/SABC/Eskom and SAA all took centre stage. #Zuma had a Q&A to remember and #Zille tweeted in defence of colonialism. Heists all round in Gangster’s Paradise, from the airport to the Chief Justice Offices. Joe Mafela died, water restrictions in Cape Town and the country became nostalgic for a past president, #ThaboMbeki. Internationally a terror attack hit #WestministerBridge, the French were about to vote for a biscuit #Macron and no one can remember what happened to #GuatemalaGirls. We were more concerned with Trump refusing to shake #Merkels’ hand and the biggest faux pas in Hollywood history with #LalaLand vs #Moonlight making headlines at the Oscars. #Stuff2017April: Probably one of the busiest months, with the #CabinetReshuffle - the axing of #Gordhan and #Jonas setting all types of media alight. The death and memorial of Kathrada, his voice coming from the grave sending #ZumaMustFall to the top of the charts. #ProtestAction started across the country as #JunkStatus loomed and rumours of the #NuclearDeal waited in the wings. Internationally, the French election overshadowed the growing refugee crisis from a forgotten Syria. #Stuff2017May: The nation kept up the protest pace with #ZumaMustFall and cabinet reshuffle still on timelines everywhere. But what were we worried about, according to #NomaGigaba if the Rand drops, “just pick it up again.” The month turned even more bitter as we cried for Karabo Mokoena carrying the #RIPKarabo, shortly followed by #MenAreTrash which in turn resulted in #MensMarch and #NotinMyName as South African men added their voices to the disgust. We saw the murder of Generations’ star #MandlaHltashwayo and just when we thought it couldn’t get any worse… #GuptaLeaks. Internationally Prince Philip retired from waving (yawn), Trump and FBI’s Comey tore chunks out of each other with Comey been shown the door - FBHi/FBBye #Stuff2017June: We were still being hit by #Gupta shockwaves only to be hit by the mother of all waves in #CapeStorm. #Zille was suspended, #MoegengMoegeng schooled #Mbete in the #NoConfidence #SecretBallot vote. Over the waters #TigerWoods got done for DUI, Trump gave the climate deal the cold shoulder because basically #Covfefe, #LondonBridge attack happened in the midst of a #UKElection and a #HungParliament. The horror of the #GrenfellFire, and investigation into #JeffSessions left international media reeling. Oh, did I mention Al Jazeera’s twitter account was shut down and the station was due to be closed down by Qatar. #Stuff2017July: The #SecretBallot speculation was rife and more dirt poured out of the #GuptaLeaks, this time, #KPMG came under fire for being wedding planners. Suddenly #BellPottinger was a household name for the wrong reasons. Good news for a change brought #WaydeVanNiekerk and #CasterSemenya at IAAF but it didn’t last long before we saw #PrisonStrippers, #AmoreVittone and the death of #RayPhiri. Surprisingly it didn’t drown out #MandelaDay and #EFF’s Anniversary but the word on everyone’s timelines was #StateCapture. The rest of the world marvelled at the #Cyberattack and Trump’s attack on CNN (read FNN – Fake News Network), the #PanamaPapers made an appearance and the world learnt the importance of #AlAqsaa mosque. #Stuff2017August: The #NoConfidence vote failed, the BBC interviewed a tool (Atul), #NandosDMGathering and #BlackFirstLandFirst kept us on our toes and #DisGraceMugabe got handy with an electrical cord. Just as we had struggled to digest #RIPKarabo, #Manana assaulted three women at #Cubana. Bonang showed that she’s no Shakespeare, the Guptas sold ANN7 and Vodacom stole our data. Putin told 700 US delegates to take a hike after a spat with Trump, North Korea hits the headlines, guess why? Trump again. Another terrorist attack, this time in Barcelona, the world wakes up to the #RefugeeCrisis and #Charlottesville taught us #BlackLivesMatter, #Venezuela took to the streets, Mayweather smacked McGregor and the biggest devastation of all enters, #HurricaneHarvey #Stuff2017September: #RamaphosaSmearCampaign hit the headlines and Parliament hotted up as #EFF painted it red.  #Juju stayed in the media getting his degree. #BafanaBafana trampled all over our #WC2018 spirit and then a #MatchFixing scandal allowed us to breathe for all of 30 seconds. The #NSFAS pays some random person R14m, #KennyKunene was called out as a character of the Matrix with the #21GunSalute assassination “attempt”. #BellPottinger hits international headlines and unravels, there’s a bloodbath at #KPMG putting #PravinGordhan back in the media with the spurious #RogueUnit story and just when we thought the month was up, #SpyTapes put us back eight years. It’s no better over the pond, #NorthKorea launches #NuclearTest, HurricaneHarvey has an evil sister #HurricaneIrma, #LasVegas makes an entrance for the wrong reasons with a mass shooting, but the #iPhoneX was released, so don’t worry about #Rohingya #Stuff2017October: Oh, Dove, you should wash your advertising mouth out with soap, #Unilever comes under fire for racist advertising, #DurbanStorm wrecks havoc amongst #Gigabyte’s eloquent #BudgetSpeech while we waited for the #NuclearDeal timebomb, and then, #JoeMaila died and we learnt that 138 patients starved to death at #LifeEsidemeni. #Catalonia fought for independence and here comes another Hurricane first name Harvey last name #Weinstein thanks to the brave Alyssa Milano’s #Metoo it took the world by storm. #Stuff2017November: The bitter #BlackMonday protest left a bad taste. Finally #Justice4Reeva as #Pistorius gets 13 years, #Panayioutou gets life. Zuma released his first #FeesCommission verdict – keep reading. #JacquesPauw released a book, Gauteng ground to a halt with #TaxiStrike and we lost the #RWC2023 bid.  All this while we were watching the #EskomInquiry and we literally broke the bank and the shopping doors on #BlackFriday. JunkStatus? What JunkStatus? Meandos Neandos... And then... deep breath... #ZimbabweCoup, it happened so fast, we were caught off guard. Just when we were learning who #HarveyWeinstein was, #KevinSpacey fell out of the #PeadophileCloset and it snowballed, one sex predator after another was named and disappeared from headlines faster than you could blink, well except #NoMoore #RoyMoore. #ParadisePapers named the #Queen and that also disappeared because, you know, there’s a royal wedding to plan. Another terror attack, this time in New York and Trump and the #MuellerInvestigation hots up. #Stuff2017December: Lynne Brown became the nation’s new villan and Life Esidemeni left us in tears. Steinhoff joined the police line up of criminals and we held our breath at the #ANCConference. #CyrilRamaphosa brought hope for literally two minutes cause then we saw the #Top6 and 68 votes went missing. Oh and, #Zuma gave us the Christmas present of #FreeEducation that may be an empty box. #Trump gave #Israel a present of his own - #Jerusalem, #California is burning but don’t worry the force is with us all as #StarWars takes to the screen. #Stuff2017I’m out!TonyaThis piece reflects the headspace of Tonya Khoury.
