They will assist in the patrols of various vulnerable areas, spot checks at strategic points such as gates with emphasis on adherence to the rules and regulations and general patrolling wherein relevant information will be given to guests. “Now and then especially during busy periods, we receive feedback from concerned tourists about rule breakers who speed on the roads in the park – which leads to road kills. Others lean or climb out of their vehicles. These vehicles are an extension to those of our traffic officials, rangers and security staff and we are certain they will assist in this regard”, said the KNP acting managing executive, Nicholus Funda. Visitors are advised to plan their journey properly and to adhere to the gate times as recorded on maps, permits and signs at the camps. The rules and regulations of the KNP are well communicated on entrance permits, signage and pamphlets, and are enforced under the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act, 2003 (Act no. 57 of 2003) and transgression can result in a spot fine of up to R1,500 and court proceedings. The amount of fine depends on the nature and severity of offence committed.
