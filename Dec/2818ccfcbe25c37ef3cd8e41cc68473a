As such, most South Africans believe that the disease isn’t something that would affect them. Little do they know that malaria still presents a significant danger, especially when travelling to endemic areas,” says Sherwin Charles, co-Founder, and CEO of Goodbye Malaria.Despite advancements in treatment, malaria remains a killer, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2016 alone, malaria caused the deaths of 445,000 people worldwide, with 80% of these deaths accounted for in 15 countries, all of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, save India.What to watch out for?Common symptoms of malaria include constant headaches, fatigue, nausea, muscle pains and sudden shifts between chills and fevers. “What makes malaria so dangerous is that it is often misdiagnosed as the flu, as they share many common symptoms. People will then just dismiss their symptoms as the easily treated flu and won’t seek medical attention. However, if left untreated, malaria could have severe repercussions for your health - even life-threatening. It is imperative that if you start to experience any of these symptoms you must immediately seek professional medical advice” says Charles.Goodbye Malaria provides the following tips and information that will allow you to protect yourself and your family from malaria this festive season:Since malaria symptoms usually only appear up to 15 days after infection, effective treatment at this stage does become difficult.
