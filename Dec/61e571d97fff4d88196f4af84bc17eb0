During these routine planned outages, one third of the used nuclear fuel is replaced with new fuel, statutory inspections and maintenance are performed, and modifications that will improve safety or the plant performance are implemented. This strategy is yielding a resounding success as the power station has operated safely and efficiently for 33 years.  Koeberg is Africa’s only nuclear power station and has an installed capacity of 1,860MW and provides 50% of Western Cape’s and approximately 5.6% of South Africa’s energy needs.
