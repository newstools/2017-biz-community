We actively encourage all business and private consumers to support and reward them for their eco-logical efforts by purchasing their products and services,” says David Parry-Davies, director of The Enviropaedia and Eco-Logic Awards.The invitation to enter the awards is open to South African small businesses, large corporate organisations, non-governmental and community-based organisations, municipalities and individuals who are leading the way in environmental excellence and innovation.“Since the competition launched in 2011, the Eco-Logic Awards has flourished and grown in scale, status and influence to become one of South Africa’s most prestigious environmental calendar events, with broad support from South Africa’s environmental authorities and thought leaders, it enjoys extensive TV, radio, print and digital coverage. We are delighted and proud of the statement made by Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu who recently said 'Eco-Logic represents a mind-set and value system that I fully support'.”The 2018 awards will recognise excellence in the following categories:Biodiversity AwardClimate Change AwardEco-Innovation AwardEnergy Efficiency AwardRecycling and Waste Management AwardTransport AwardWater Conservation AwardGreen Economy AwardMunicipalities AwardEco-Youth AwardEco-Community AwardEco-Angel Award andEco-Warrior Award“The Eco-Logic value system is a radically new approach to addressing today’s environmental challenges. It identifies the destructive thinking patterns and values that have led to today’s environmental critical conditions, and promotes an alternative set of constructive values and thinking patterns (the seven virtues of Eco-Logic) that support and benefit people, planet and a green economy,” says Parry-Davies.A panel of highly experienced and knowledgeable judges from senior positions in the private and public sectors will use these ‘virtues of Eco-Logic’ to assess each entry based on the following:Benefits and regenerates the Earth,Reflects long-term, sustainable thinking,Embraces a broadly inclusive and systemic thinking,Demonstrates an Ubuntu care and consideration for others,Is of excellent quality and ethical standard of production,Demonstrates innovation and/or an inspirational vision,Reflects ‘Eco-Logical wisdom’ by being both intellectually and emotionally intelligent.Up to five of the best entries from each category will be invited to attend the ‘glamorously green’ Eco-Logic Gala Awards evening in June 2018.
