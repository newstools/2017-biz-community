Moeng said the import of counterfeit clothing and textiles and other infringements - including under-declaration and misclassification - was a massive problem."As a result, customs is also focusing on plugging the leaks at non-designated border posts," he said."Three weeks ago, there was a bust of suspected counterfeit clothing and footwear, with a value of R1.2-million, at Kosi Bay [north-eastern border]."That border post, in particular, was targeted for being a hotspot of smuggling, due to the lack of controls."Every day since the start of the special three-week operation at nondesignated border posts, Customs has detained suspected illicit or illegally smuggled goods."Once we have assessed the risk at these border posts, we will focus on strategy and capacity planning at nondesignated ports going forward."Many factories have closed down in the past few years due to the proliferation of cheap legitimate imports, as well as the illegal importation of second-hand and counterfeit clothes and shoes, mostly from Asia."<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/419305-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Material hurdles remain" width="120" height="120">Material hurdles remainFor a short while, some time around 2014, it looked as if the clothing, textile, footwear & leather (CTFL) sector was beginning to recover after almost 20 years of crippling pressure...20 Nov 2017SARS had introduced measures - such as new risk rules - to address infringements, Moeng said."We are working on numerous clothing and textile cases worth millions of rands," he said.
