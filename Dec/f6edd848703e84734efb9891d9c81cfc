This year’s full jury, to be announced shortly, includes top advertising creatives and designers from around the world. Entries can be submitted here, final deadline is 31 January 2018. New tiered pricing structureA significant change to this year’s awards program is a tiered pricing structure designed to make it easier for smaller agencies, studios and freelancers to participate. Companies with 21 or more employees pay the standard entry fee; smaller shops with from 2 to 20 employees get a discount on entries (amount varies by discipline) and freelance creatives and one-person shops are eligible for an even greater reduction in their entry fee.“ADC Annual Awards identify and celebrate the absolute best in craft, design and innovation from around the world, no matter what size the submitting agency or design firm might be,” said Kevin Swanepoel, CEO, The One Club for Creativity. “This new tiered pricing structure helps level the playing field and makes it easier for smaller shops and independent designers, photographers, illustrators and typographers to get their work judged by an all-star creative jury and elevated on a global stage. It also reflects our new mission to support and celebrate the success of the entire global creative community regardless of company size or location.”ADC Annual Awards juries focus on craft, design and innovation, while juries for The One Club for Creativity’s One Show Awards judge work based on creativity of ideas and quality of execution.Judging takes place in March 2018 and finalists announced in April in lead up to the ADC 97th Annual Awards Ceremony on 7 May 2018 as part of Creative Week in New York.
