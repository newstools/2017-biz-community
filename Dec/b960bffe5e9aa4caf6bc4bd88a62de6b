Design details include timber wall panelling, colourful rope weave details and printed patterns on the table tops.The look and feel was created in collaboration with Doctor and Misses, David Krynauw, The Streets Furniture Company, Pedersen and Lennard, Kent and Lane, Egg Designs, and SF Interiors. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423446.jpg" alt="New-look Nando's opens in Grand West" width="600" height="382">Like all Nando’s across the world, the refurbished restaurant features unique design touches and original local South African art. The selected accents combine ethnic, contemporary and Mozambican influences, which act as a backdrop to showcase and support South African furniture and industrial design. “We are always striving to create the best dine-in experience for our customers, and can’t wait for you to join our table at our Grand West Casino restaurant,” concludes Spinks.
