The content was dressed up to look independently produced but actually was paid for by the Huntsman Cancer Foundation.The programming aired more than 1,700 times, and the payment was not disclosed, according to the FCC."The FCC's sponsorship identification rules help ensure that consumers know who is trying to persuade them through paid programming," the FCC said in a statement.The Huntsman Cancer Institute is a cancer research facility in Utah founded by the industrial chemicals magnate Jon Huntsman Sr., whose son Jon Huntsman Jr. is a Republican former diplomat and governor.The foundation, which raises funds for the institute, said it ended its contract with Sinclair after learning its ads were not properly labeled, according to Bloomberg.Sinclair has 30 days to contest the fine or pay it.Last year, Sinclair paid a $9.5 million fine to the FCC over unrelated violations.Source: AFP
