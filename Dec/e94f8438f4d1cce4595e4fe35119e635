We are all connected in this world and through Ubuntu we believe that by doing our part, however small, we can make life better for others and ultimately for ourselves. It is Desmond Tutu who said: <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423589.jpg" alt="Tozer Events &amp; Marketing Gives The Gift Of Hope" width="300" height="448">“Do your little bit of good where you are; it is those little bits of good put all together that overwhelm the world.”It is in this spirit of Ubuntu that Tozer Events & Marketing decided to do their little bit of good by spending time with and donating supplies to 15 babies at Door of Hope, a non-profit organisation that gives abandoned babies a second chance at life and the gift of hope. This year Tozer Events & Marketing, an agency that specialises in corporate brand building for local and international clients, used the funds that would’ve otherwise been spent on Christmas gifts for their clients to give to Door of Hope. On 15 December 2017, they also held a special photoshoot for the 15 babies between four and 12 months at the Glenvista house in Johannesburg to create memories for their photobook which they can take with them to their forever families. Through this the team at Tozer Events hopes to raise awareness of the important and necessary work Door of Hope does and hopefully build a strong and ongoing relationship in the years to come. The Door of Hope Children’s Mission is a non-profit organisation established in 1999 by the Berea Baptist Mission Church. Still to this day poverty is a very real challenge countless people face in South Africa. Because of it many mothers do not feel emotionally or financially equipped with the challenge to raise a child and they will often abandon their babies in dustbins, open fields and public toilets. It was under these circumstances and under the leadership of Pastor Cheryl Allen, that the church made a hole in their wall and a ‘Baby Bin’ was installed. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423590.jpg" alt="Tozer Events &amp; Marketing Gives The Gift Of Hope" width="207" height="309"><img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423591.jpg" alt="Tozer Events &amp; Marketing Gives The Gift Of Hope" width="207" height="309"><img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423592.jpg" alt="Tozer Events &amp; Marketing Gives The Gift Of Hope" width="207" height="309">It allowed mothers to leave their babies in safe environment any time, day or night, for the church to take care of them. The moment a baby is placed, care workers on duty receive an electronic signal alerting them. The baby is taken in and the anonymity of the “donor” is ensured. News quickly spread and other babies have been brought personally by their mothers or have come through other means such as the police, community members, hospitals or clinics to Door of Hope.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423584.jpg" alt="Tozer Events &amp; Marketing Gives The Gift Of Hope" width="300" height="366" rel="">click to enlargeToday there are three houses that employ 56 permanent staff members. Here they take care of the babies and toddlers and they work hard to restore their hope and help them find their forever families. To date they have been able to help more than 1500 babies and assist with over 650 adoptions. With assistance from Door of Hope and social workers some babies are returned to the care of their mothers while others find a home and family at the Door of Hope Village – a community of moms, dad, uncles, aunties, uncles, grannies, grandpas and cousins to love and cherish them. In the future, the Tozer Events Team would like to grow this initiative into a longstanding relationship with Door of Hope through the help of their clients.
