He has released six top 10 singles and toured extensively throughout South Africa. In 2014, Clegg brought his music to the international stage with a seven-week tour across the United States and Canada, and returned to North America in 2016 for his second North American Tour, playing 36 shows across the continent. Jesse released Things Unseen in June this year with the singles "Use Me", "Souvenir" and "Breathing" all charting nationally.In September, following on from the radio success of the dynamic DJ Kent’s remix of "Breathing" (featuring Shekhinah), Clegg released a re-imagined music video for the single. Blending Clegg's songwriting, Shekhinah's soulful voice and Kent's instantly recognisable beats, the track is now accompanied by a moody and emotive music video that captures the essence and energy of the song.
