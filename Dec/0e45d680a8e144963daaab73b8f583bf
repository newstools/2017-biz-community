"The friendships you make over a 3am Gyros in Mykonos will be friendships that will stay with you for a lifetime, and the people you interact with and cultures you’re exposed to have a profound impact on your tolerance and understanding. Contiki’s unique social travel experience sets millennial travellers up to have better relationships with their friends, family and with their wider communities at home, through the skills they learn through their travel experiences.”The survey results give strong evidence that experiencing new cultures and viewpoints through travel, in turn, enhances character attributes which prove a positive impact on citizenship, such as perspective, empathy and appreciation. Despite young people spending a greater amount of time away from their native countries when travelling, young people who travel do in fact gain a greater sense of citizenship than those who have not travelled internationally. More information on The Power of TravelThe researchContiki commissioned Story and Verse and Fan Data Analytics - two third-party professional research and insight organisations - to conduct this research. Story and Verse enlisted the expertise of Adam Ganlinsky, PhD, Columbia Business School, to advise in the form of an interview about the character attributes that change as a result of travel, as indicated by his own academic research. These include empathetic concern, perspective-taking, generalised trust, interracial connection, open-minded thinking, learning goal orientation and general self-efficacy. Fan Data Analytics, using this insight, conducted a survey of a pool of 2,980 18-35-year-olds from the United Kingdom (824), United States (514), Canada (513), Australia (520), South Africa (305) and New Zealand (303). The response pool was broken into equal groups of travellers and non-travellers, as defined below: • Travellers: someone who has travelled outside of their home country • Non-travellers: someone who has not travelled outside of their home country All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from Fan Data Analytics.
