Pictures of the celebration were posted on Lukau's Facebook page with a message thanking his "spiritual sons and precious daughter for the topclass toy gift".This prompted Izang, the outspoken editor and founder of Christian magazine The Parable, to ask his Facebook followers: "Should Christians give to rich pastors?"Izang had in May been ordered by the Johannesburg High Court to stop publishing defamatory comments about Lukau, his wife, or his church.Johannesburg High Court Judge Majake Mabesele found Izang in contempt of court for his latest comments about the Rolls-Royce and the penthouse and sentenced him to 20 days in jail, suspended for two years.The judge said in his ruling: "The respondent never published, directly, statements which defamed the applicants. However, his positive response to an adverse comment that the first applicant is a false prophet indirectly defamed the applicant. Therefore, the respondent should be found to be in contempt of the order granted."Source: The Times
