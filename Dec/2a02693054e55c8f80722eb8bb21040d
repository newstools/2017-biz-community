Currently, MUT has a new council that seeks to understand what went wrong in the past so that it can place MUT on a firm footing."So the request for the services of an independent assessor is for developmental purposes. Far from being an admission of failure, this request is a demonstration of the new council's determination to ensure good governance at MUT."In 2016, the university was plunged into chaos after six senior officials including the vice-chancellor were placed on suspension. The six officials resigned when a forensic report into allegations of financial mismanagement was concluded. The institution is yet to fill some of the vacancies.MPs have demanded that the university take action against implicated officials, even if they had left the institution."The principal purpose of this assessment should be to try and identify any governance failures in the past and the possible complicity of the previous council. It is therefore the desire of the new council to make sure that there is no repeat of such failures. So the request of the services of an independent assessor is a corrective initiative of the new council to build a new MUT," the spokeswoman said.Source: Business Day
