And there is a very anxious feeling of uncertainty pertaining to what will happen in January. Should the CoS agreement be terminated by December 31 as NMU stated, there will be nothing protecting the staff and their salaries next year."While we are well aware of the current challenges facing the tertiary education sector, our concern is that annually there are negotiations regarding the agreement and we find a compromise. Yet now they took the unilateral decision to terminate the agreement."In an e-mail sent jointly by NTEU and Nehawu to all staff regarding the boycott, they referred to the event as an attempt to create the image of a benevolent university."For management to have invited staff to attend such a lavish event, straight after informing them that austerity measures require the termination of their CoS agreement, is shameless."Nehawu branch secretary Kayode Adesemowo said: "We don't have the actual numbers but we know more than a thousand staff were invited, and from a head- count done through photos of the event we estimate no more than 300 people in attendance."Mbabela said the event was the annual year-end function which coincided with Swartz's last year at the helm of NMU."While it is unfortunate that some staff chose to heed the call to boycott the event, we are mindful of their right to express themselves," Mbabela said."The budget came to R250,000. From the RSVPs received, about 1,500 staff members were expected at the event and more than 500 actually attended."The decision to terminate the CoS has prompted the unions to take NMU to the Port Elizabeth Labour Court to prevent the implementation of its notice.The matter was before court on Friday, but Adesemowo said judgment had been reserved."Employees are unsure, angry and demoralised as a result of these wage negotiations."The unions and management returned to the ombudsman last week to discuss the issue of Cole. The university is giving 0% and not willing to budge hence we need the intervention of the ombudsman and we are now awaiting his feedback."Mbabela said: "The intended termination of the CoS does not affect the university policies that regulate employees' terms and benefits of employment."The last two years have seen the university undertake a massive reintegration project where nearly 900 service level employees of previously outsourced service functions in the cleaning, gardening, catering and protection services are being absorbed into the university as permanent employees."This, and other challenges facing the higher education sector, place strain on the university's financial resources and require re-imagination of resource utilisation."Source: Herald
