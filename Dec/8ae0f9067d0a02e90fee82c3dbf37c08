By applying the code to their website’s scripts, the site analyses the visitors’ GPS-position to determine if they are driving. If they exceed a speed of 20 km/h, the site will be blocked until the visitor confirms that they aren’t the driver of a vehicle in order to continue to surf the site.For more, go to www.safetycode.se.
