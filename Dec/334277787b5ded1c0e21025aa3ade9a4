This year the Awards, which recognise the public relations (PR) industry and its work, celebrate its 20th year. The aim is to get 300 entries - a far cry from the five in its inaugural year...By Danette Breitenbach 16 Mar 2017“I enjoyed meeting the industry greats and learning about not just how to judge the awards, but how the industry works and the standards that are expected from PR professionals. So, I’m so excited to be part of the committee selecting next year’s judges because I know how much they’re going to benefit from the experience,” said Bongani Mogari, PR coordinator at Seven Colors Communications and 2017 Prisms Young Judge.I spoke to Madumo and Mogari to find out more about what the judging process entails, their opinion on what award shows means for the industry as a whole and what factors will make winning work stand out for them.Mogari says being announced as one of the young judges was one of the best highlights in his PR and communication career. “It made me realise that my work is being noticed and I am part of a body that takes priority in how campaigns are being conveyed to the public. I now understand the ethics and the importance of ensuring that campaigns are communicated according to be well received by the public.”Prisms are opening up the industryHe also says that awards like Prisms are important because they unearth services provided by different agencies.Collaborations emerge and we see who is also the best in the industry. Also with the element of involving young judges, skills and knowledge us being transferred. Such awards create a cycle of success within the PR space. Prisms are sure opening up the industry.Maduma revealed that the judging process is extremely detailed and requires a minimum of five days, but she says that it can take up to two weeks depending on the number of entries allocated to you. “Each public relations campaign entered in the Prism Awards must exhibit a high standard of excellence in a variety of campaign aspects. Specifically, each entry is judged on the basis of its competence in five areas, namely, statement of opportunity, research, planning, execution and measurement. And then, a day is dedicated to all the judges convening to discuss, assess and make a decision on each entry leading to the final winners per category.”Mogari adds that what will make winning work stand out, is new ideas, innovative solutions and a team that will implement a new concept to be the best. “At the moment my A team is my fellow young judges we are the first generation and we plan to take others through our journey as we wait for the 2018 Prism Awards."The awards will take place in April 2018 and the closing date for entries is on 2 February 2018.
