He says, “Tanya is an incredible force at Richmark, a dynamic and intelligent woman who accomplishes anything that she sets her mind to. I knew that she would do us proud at the sleepout and she has, having pulled out all the stops to become the leading fundraiser of the event. Well done, Tanya, we are so impressed!”Both Varejes and Harvey have reiterated what an impact the sleepout experience has made on them. As Harvey notes, “As someone who has the opportunity to go out and make a difference in the lives of those who are less fortunate, this experience was a big reminder to constantly strive to make a difference. Thank you to Gavin Varejes and Richmark Holdings for the nomination and the support and thank you to The Philanthropic Collection for hosting this amazing and worthy event.”
