However, along with the great prospects, there will also be greater competition for positions, which means that prospective entrants into the field should ensure they can stand apart from their peers with a solid qualification, focused both on theory and practical experience, under their belt.“All studies and forecasts also underscore the continued creation of jobs in this sector, which is good news for those who are considering this exciting field,” says Erika Theron, academic dean at The Private Hotel School, an Advtech tertiary institution based in Stellenbosch.Deon Roets, academic head at Capsicum, Advetech’s culinary school, agrees that opportunity combined with education in the field bodes well for the future of hospitality and culinary professionals.“Consumers continue to become more educated and discerning, and any business in the hospitality industry is well aware of the need for their employees to be professional and effective in the workplace, and to ensure that valued visitors receive the best possible service and experience,” he says.“The hospitality industry isn’t just expanding internationally. The growth in South Africa remains exceptional but with more discerning consumers it is critical that training focuses on ensuring that graduates are able to cope with demanding customers,” says Roets.Statistics show that the tourism sector remains one of the fastest-growing economic sectors, contributing about 4.5% to total employment in 2015/2016. SA saw a 14% growth in tourist numbers from August 2015-August 2016 and 1,200 new hotel rooms between July-December 2017. A staggering 20,000 new jobs were created since 2014.
