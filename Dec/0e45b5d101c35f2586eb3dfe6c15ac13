By creating this positive experiential learning experience, the subject matter will really come alive for the learners,” comments Nduvane. Despite being situated in a disadvantaged community characterised by high unemployment, Fairvale Secondary School has consistently risen above these circumstances, defying the odds with impressive matric results. Last year, the matric pass rate was 76%, up from the previous year's 74% pass rate. “We are very grateful to Engen for their support. The biggest impact for us will be the reaction from our teachers and students when they see their new facilities. They will be so proud of the new environment in which they can thrive and learn,” says Dale Seidle, principal of Fairvale Secondary School.
