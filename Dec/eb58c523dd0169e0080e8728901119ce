Customers can connect to all AWS infrastructure regions around the world (except China) from locations in Johannesburg and Cape Town and their traffic will remain in the Amazon backbone network throughout the entire journey.For many years AWS has been working with organisations of all sizes in South Africa, from the newest startups through to some of the most well-known, household names to help them move workloads to the cloud. One of the main requests AWS has received from South African customers has been to help reduce costs and improve network performance from on-premises environments to AWS infrastructure Regions located in Europe, the US, and around the world.LocationsThe new AWS Direct Connect location in Johannesburg is located at the Teraco JB1 facility and in Cape Town at the Teraco CT1 facility. If customers have equipment within these facilities they can use Direct Connect to optimise their connection to AWS. If their equipment is located somewhere else, they can work with one of AWS’ APN Partners supporting Direct Connect or their carrier to establish a connection from their location to the Teraco AWS Direct Connection location nearest to them, and from there on to AWS.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1703/386372-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Amazon Web Services introduces Amazon Connect" width="120" height="120">Amazon Web Services introduces Amazon ConnectAmazon Web Services (AWS) has introduced Amazon Connect, a self-service, cloud-based contact centre service...1 Apr 2017AWS Direct Connect provides 1Gbps and 10Gbps connections, and customers can easily provision multiple connections if they need more capacity. Customers can avail lower bandwidth connections of 50Mbps to 500Mbps through our APN Partners supporting AWS Direct Connect. Customers can also use AWS Direct Connect instead of establishing a VPN connection over the Internet, avoiding the need to utilize VPN hardware that frequently can’t support data transfer rates above 4 Gbps.For more, go to the AWS website.
