Allan Gray instructed the new team to sell or close unprofitable businesses.The trading statement said there had been "a general unwind in the South African construction order book" during the reporting period."Construction will eventually consist of a buildings and housing business, despite the reduction of work anticipated in the first half of 2018, where the group has a proven track record, and a small, nimble civil engineering business in SA."
