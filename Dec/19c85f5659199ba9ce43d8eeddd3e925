What I usually find is that it’s rarely followed up by the requisite tools or roadmaps to actually achieve this said ‘disruption’. This I believe is what sets us apart. Since 1990, thanks to Jean Marie Dru – the father of disruption inspired our 375 agencies across 100 countries to rally round the disruption methodology, ultimately making it our adopted, registered operating system. In his book, The New Ways to New – 15 Paths to Disruption, Dru explains in detail how disruption at TBWA falls into three parts. Starting with ‘convention’, we identify all the things that competitors are doing in this starting process. We discover accepted wisdom the consumer is stuck in, and we find the baggage in the brands history that is holding it down. Status quo is something you need to understand completely before you can think of challenging or overturning it.  <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/420816.jpg" alt="TBWA\Hunt Lascaris launches iconic MTN brand campaign" width="120" height="120">TBWA\Hunt Lascaris launches iconic MTN brand campaignMTN has taken the wraps off its new television commercial which is bold in orientation, audacious in outlook and disruptive in content as it entices customers to move over to the BrightSide in line with the operator's new brand ethos...Issued by TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris 28 Nov 2017Once the conventions are unearthed, you then need a ‘vision’, your north star if you will, which we will steer your brand toward. In order to break convention, and to move toward our vision, we need to conceive an idea that is as provocative as it can be.  And this is finally the ‘disruption’, an original angle on the business that helps untie conventions it is trapped in, and allows the brand to leap ahead of the competition.  Convention, vision and disruption: taken together, constitute our operating system. This is how we see the world. This is how we find growth.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422217.jpg" alt="Bite-Size Ballet performs a rain dance for the Western Cape" width="120" height="120">Bite-Size Ballet performs a rain dance for the Western CapeWith Western Cape dam levels reaching record lows, TBWA\Hunt Lascaris and Joburg Ballet wanted to contribute to the conversation while raising much-needed awareness around water conservation...Issued by TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris 2 days ago
