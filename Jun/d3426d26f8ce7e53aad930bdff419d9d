The tour route incorporated stadiums, hospitals, landmarks like Constitution Hill and Mandela Bridge, and a number of stopovers at shopping centres to engage with shoppers and retailers, as well as driving through residential areas to show the different types of household dwellings. A local lunch experience was enjoyed at Sakumzi in Vilakasi Street and the following day lunch at PataPata restaurant in Maboneng. On the Dot provided an educational information leaflet on all points of interest that were covered over the two days. &#x201c;We spent two days on a tour with OtD as our hosts. We travelled the streets of Johannesburg from Alexandra, to Soweto, then Maboneneng, Newton and Braamfontein. It was a great experience and gave us insights into the Johannesburg landscape. This two-day tour was well organised and OTD were friendly, knowledgeable and flexible. I would highly recommend other advertisers/agencies to look into this offering to immerse yourself/clients into the markets of interest, for better understanding of who you are marketing to." - Simon Bunkell, Bain & Bunkell On the Dot provides rich demographic data on all households in South Africa with a reach of 15.2 million households.
