Motsoeneng was "aggrieved" by the ruling and would meet his legal team on Monday to discuss what form the challenge would take, Majavu said. Motsoeneng confirmed that he had received the ruling. But he refused to say what he planned to do next. "I don't want to talk about my future or my plans because my focus right now is on this legal matter." Motsoeneng was fired by the public broadcaster on Monday after being found guilty of misconduct relating to comments he made at a media briefing in April. At the briefing Motsoeneng criticised SABC board members and the parliamentary committee looking into alleged irregularities at the corporation. The outcome of Motsoeneng's disciplinary hearing was made public after the SABC's interim board met Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo. Source: The Times
