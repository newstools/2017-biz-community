Dr Rob Adam"Nuclear has a key role to play in providing carbon-free baseload power in South Africa and the rest of the world. Renewables and nuclear are needed in a globally responsible energy future," he said. Adam's career spans both the public and private sector. After serving as a director general in the department of science and technology, he served as the CEO of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa). He later joined the Aveng Group as the group executive responsible for nuclear. He is now the director of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) where he would like to focus his attention but remains a staunch Niasa member. Current vice president, Sandisiwe Ncemane, will steer the organisation, till a permanent replacement is found.
