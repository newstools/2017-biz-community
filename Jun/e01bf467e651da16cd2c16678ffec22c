Mace with the rest of the Tusker job crew. The Silver Screen he won at the 2017 Young Director Awards is actually a new country record as this is Mace&#x2019;s third Young Director Award in just two years at Cannes Lions. Dan Mace becomes first South African to win three Young Director Awards at CannesEgg Films' Dan Mace won his third Young Director Award in two years at Cannes Lions, a South African record...Issued by Egg Films 1 day ago Impressive stuff. I pinned down Mace for his views on SA&#x2019;s performance at Cannes Lions 2017, the calibre of the SA craft and production scene and more&#x2026; Share your views on SA&#x2019;s performance at Cannes Lions 2017 and how this ties in with our already impressive wins at D&AD and One Show earlier this year. Jeez, where do I begin? First off, well done to Terence Neale for being the first SA director to ever win a Grand Prix at Cannes! That&#x2019;s just pure inspiration. Terence Neale becomes first SA director to win Cannes Lions Grand PrixEgg Films' director Terence Neale is the first South African director ever to win a Grand Prix at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, the world's most prestigious advertising awards...Issued by Egg Films 22 Jun 2017 I also loved seeing Sunu walking away with a bunch of awards; I&#x2019;ve seen him grafting so hard everyday since I have been at Egg. Sunu wins Gold, two Silvers and Bronze at Cannes LionsEgg Films' Sunu took home Gold, two Silvers and Bronze in the Entertainment, Entertainment for Music and Media categories at Cannes Lions...Issued by Egg Films 22 Jun 2017 I feel like the South African presence was huge this year, not just in film, entertainment and craft, but in radio as well. We don&#x2019;t need awards to believe in our work, but they are a great indication of where you stand in your field internationally, so to read the list of winners from SA is pretty awesome. Does international success stand us in good stead for local accolades, such as the Loeries? Elaborate! Awards are always a lottery. I don&#x2019;t think you can ever bank on winning anything. An award doesn&#x2019;t measure your talent or success, but rather how current and relatable your creative ideas were with that certain project. I am, however, feeling really positive for Egg Films&#x2019; awards prospects at the Loeries this year; there are just too many great productions not to walk away with a bunch of rad statues! Let&#x2019;s talk about the calibre of the SA craft and production scene &#x2013; where do we shine and where do we need to buff and bulk up our muscle? That&#x2019;s a tricky question. I do believe that craft and production are bettered the bigger the budgets, but this does not mean it&#x2019;s impossible to shine with no money, either. It all depends of the concept and the way in which the director envisions it. If there&#x2019;s a great synergy here, the director will be able to connect with his key crew in a special way in order to create something really epic. We are an industry that&#x2019;s growing every day and we aren&#x2019;t scared to take risks &#x2013; that&#x2019;s where we shine. I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s much negative to say about the industry as a whole, as from what I can see it&#x2019;s really strengthening. I am still new to this world, so giving negative feedback wouldn't really be fair, either. Balanced and inspirational as always.
