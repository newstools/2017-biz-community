Solar energy has become very attractive to several African countries and the show attracts some of the largest solar service providers and manufacturers to demonstrate to commercial and cross-border trading practices their solutions and technologies. We represented DuPont attractively and professionally in order to compete competitively as they showcased their range of photovoltaic products to trade visitors.
