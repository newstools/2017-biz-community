As fantastical as these ideas sound, they are plausible. Augmented reality (AR) refers to the addition of computer-generated content to our existing world to enhance our experience, using devices like smartphone apps and Smart Glasses. Virtual reality (VR) takes this further, and simulates a distinct new reality, predominantly through the use of headsets and 360 videos. Both technologies are on the market as you read this. &#x201c;AR and VR offer powerful tools for events, from exhibitions and conferences, to product launches and mall activations,&#x201d; says Justin Hawes, MD of Scan Display, a leader in the exhibition, events and retail display industries. &#x201c;Not only do they provide creative ways to share information about your brand with people, but they do so by engaging the senses experientially, which makes the events more memorable.&#x201d; There are other benefits, too. &#x201c;Events can be limited by space, time and other practical considerations. For example, if a brand is exhibiting, they may not have a large enough space to showcase all of their products, or they may be reluctant to put high value items on the stand. AR and VR can overcome these challenges,&#x201d; adds Justin. To demonstrate how AR technologies can be used at events, Scan Display will be incorporating it on its stand at the Marketing, Advertising and Design Exhibition (Madex) co-located next to Markex 2017 &#x2013; and you are invited to come and try it out! Here&#x2019;s what you can expect: You&#x2019;ll be able to explore one of the company&#x2019;s best-selling retail products, the Modular Retail Kiosk (MRK), with AR. Using the Markit AR app, scanning a 2D image of the MRK will generate a virtual 3D model that you can manipulate to explore from different angles, up close and far away. An AR photo booth will also be set up. This provides technology similar to a green screen, but without the need for an actual green screen. You&#x2019;ll be able to take a photo of yourself where you control the backdrop, for a fun and personalised image. Richard Melvin is the Sales and Marketing Director of BizAR Reality, the interactive software development company that will be supplying all of these technologies on Scan Display&#x2019;s stand. He adds, &#x201c;Augmented and Virtual Reality is setting a new standard that will change the way we experience events. The technology will not only enhance communications, storytelling and overall engagement but will allow exhibitors to turn products and services into experiences.&#x201d; To test out this leading edge tech, visit the Scan Display stand at Madex &#x2013; stand A26 in Hall 1 &#x2013; at the Sandton Convention Centre on 7 and 8 June 2017. BizAR Reality will have a representative on the stand to answer any of your questions. While there, you will also be able to pick up Scan Display&#x2019;s new portfolio showcasing all of its latest products, and enjoy a complimentary cup of coffee.
