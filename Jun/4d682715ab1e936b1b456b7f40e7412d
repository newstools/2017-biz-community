&#x201c;We are extremely excited about our investment in Palladium and making our mark in the growing South African software ecosystem. Palladium aligns well with Rectron&#x2019;s strategy to grow its cloud and software business,&#x201d; says Spencer Chen, managing director of Rectron. &#x201c;Not only will Palladium add value to Rectron&#x2019;s product line, but we believe that our broad-based resellers will benefit from using the in-house developed ERP software too, as it is feature-packed with functionality that would ordinarily only be available to larger corporates." Palladium believes that this partnership will help it to catapult the business in the South African channel through Rectron's broad base of resellers. Palladium currently offers a hosted solution and with a full cloud solution on the way, it is well poised for growth in the South African market.
