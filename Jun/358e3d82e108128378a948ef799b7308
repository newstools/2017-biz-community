A screenshot of the Outsurance Father s Day ad. Image credit: IOL.co.za Captioned &#x2018;Happy #FathersDay to all amazing dads out there&#x2019;, the social media ad portrayed mostly white fathers (only one black father) spending time with their kids to celebrate Father&#x2019;s Day, suggesting that that only white men make good fathers. Outsurance apologised in a tweet: &#x201c;We apologise for our Father's Day video. It did not appropriately represent SA's demographics. It was an unintentional oversight.&#x201d; Providing further comment, Peter Cronj , head of marketing at the insurance company, blamed a junior staff member. &#x201c;This advert was created by one of our junior ladies in the social media department and I believe she made an innocent mistake when she created and posted this video. &#x201c;This is the first time we have had trouble with one of our ads because we make sure that they are representative of the country&#x2019;s demographics,&#x201d; Cronj told The Star.
