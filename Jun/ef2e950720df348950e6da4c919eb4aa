click to enlargeLux has often been associated with beauty pageants and now the brand says it's taking a stand to embrace women for more than just their outward appearance. With the &#x2018;We Are More&#x2019; campaign the brand wants to shift perception from taking women at face value and embracing their many hidden personas that are often ignored. &#x201c;Lux believes women are so much more than meets the eye; they are mothers, sisters, wives, business women, leaders, mentors, caregivers to name but a few things. The brand has developed a platform for all women to showcase their hidden facets that are often overlooked,&#x201d; said Sphelele Mjadu, PR lead for Africa, Unilever Personal Care. "Music is the soul of the country, it excites the nation and gets them moving and this is what the brand envisaged with the #WeAreMore campaign. It wants to empower every woman in South Africa to stand up and have the confidence to express her multifaceted beauty. The song will inspire women to feel proud of who they are, confident in their own skin and being open to sharing their stories with the world," said the company.
