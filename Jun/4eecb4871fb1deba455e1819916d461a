The Flavour Lab concept is used to highlight the versatility of Tabasco and prove that it&#x2019;s more than a condiment, but also an exciting ingredient for an array of food and beverages. Tuna tartar savoury cups, churros with dark chocolate sauce, spicy Bloody Mary cocktails and a range of other delectable treats all containing Tabasco as an ingredient were served to drive this point home. Preparation of dishes was done by local chefs Clayton Bell and Vittorio Bianchi of Villa 47 and Tabasco international chef Gary Evans, who has been at the helm of Tabasco as the company&#x2019;s corporate chef for the past five years. The occasion, which held the format of global Flavour Lab events, included a mixology bar and a number of flavour stations used to &#x2018;edutain&#x2019; attendees by explaining the individual flavour profiles of the pepper sauces and demonstrated how using them as an additional ingredient in popular homemade dishes, like guacamole and prawn cocktail, elevated them from &#x2018;good&#x2019; to &#x2018;great&#x2019;. Brand heritage The McIlhenny Company is family-owned and has operated continuously since 1868 with its headquarters in Avery Island, Louisiana. The company&#x2019;s Tabasco-branded products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world and labelled in 22 languages and dialects. The pepper sauces &#x2013; of which 164 million bottles are consumed annually &#x2013; contain no added preservatives, artificial additives or gluten, and are Kosher and Halaal. Interestingly, Tabasco pepper sauce is the same today as it was 148 years ago. Check out all the Cape Town Flavour Lab action in our event gallery.
