An inspection of a second travel bag led to the discovery of four more horns. &#x201c;The arrest of the two individuals who were flying out of South Africa to Hong Kong is further confirmation of the success of the multi-disciplinary law enforcement effort being undertaken to combat rhino poaching and wildlife crime under the umbrella of the Integrated Strategic Management of Rhinoceros,&#x201d; said Molewa.
