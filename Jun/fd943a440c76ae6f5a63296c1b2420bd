The two new hotels currently under construction are being built to international standards and specifications with the latest technology and facilities. BON Hotel Lekki, situated on the Lekki Peninsula, Victoria Island, is due to open in June 2018 and will provide a four-star, international, 45-room hotel catering to the corporate and business market. The second acquisition is BON Hotel Elvis Wuse2, a four-star, 85-roomed, luxury hotel located in the heart of Abuja, primed for the business traveller, due to open later this year. CEO of BON Hotels Guy Stehlik says that within a short space of time the group has become a number one player in Nigeria, which just reiterates their belief in and commitment to the region. He adds that BON Hotels&#x2019; success has been made possible largely by the experienced staff in place and the considerable time and energy the group has engaged in skills development and transformation in Nigeria &#x201c;The reality is that we have gone from having no presence in the area to becoming the largest operator, based on hotels, in less than 12 months, which demonstrates our primary strength at identifying and managing hotels under difficult circumstances in Africa,&#x201d; he remarks.
