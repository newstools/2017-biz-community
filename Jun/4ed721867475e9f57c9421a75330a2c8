Since opening its doors in Cape Town in 2013, SOLA Future Energy has been responsible for the design, construction and monitoring of 25 large rooftop PV systems, resulting in over 11MW of installed capacity across South Africa. Included in this portfolio is Redefine&#x2019;s Black River Park, one of the first buildings in Cape Town to successfully sell electricity back on to the municipal grid and Robben Island, a fully self sufficient hybrid PV battery project. Gauteng projects In Gauteng, SOLA Future Energy has already carried out several projects, including Growthpoint&#x2019;s Key West Mall, Sasol&#x2019;s Cradlestone Mall, Secunda Mall, Goldfields Head Office, and three systems for Netcare Hospitals. In addition, the company has recently secured agreements with Atterbury Property Group and Ekhuruleni Municipality. &#x201c;Rooftop solar is a new, but growing market in Africa,&#x201d; said Jonathan Skeen, GM of SOLA Future Energy Johannesburg. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re lucky that we have designed, constructed and continue to maintain such a diverse portfolio of projects &#x2013; and having a base in Johannesburg will help to expand that. African businesses are realising that putting solar on their roof makes good business sense,&#x201d; he added.
