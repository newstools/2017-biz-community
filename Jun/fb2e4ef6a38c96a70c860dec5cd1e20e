Former Eskom chairman, Ben NgubaneThe state-owned company's (SOC) exec has been implicited in former public protector, Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report, and the whistle-blowing behemoth of emails linking government and SOC office bearers to the Gupta family. He was also a staunch supporter of the erstwhile CEO of Eskom, Brian Molefe. Although, to his credit, Molefe did away with load shedding, he resigned from his position late last year, when Madonsela's report showed he'd been in regular contact with the Guptas. He was then reinstated in May, amid all sorts of speculation, only to be forced out of the position within a few days. Now it seems that Ngubane has jumped ship, although opposition political parties have said his resignation doesn't exempt him for answering to the parliamentary committee on the State of Capture and email charges. "Dr Ben Ngubane has resigned with immediate effect as non-executive director and chairperson of the board of Eskom. Dr Ngubane formally tendered his resignation, which I accepted. To ensure continuity at Eskom, I have decided to appoint Mr Zethembe Khoza as interim chairperson until I am able to take new board appointments to cabinet for approval," said Brown.
