The Print & Publishing Lions celebrate creativity in circulation. Entries need to demonstrate ideas that leap off the page and exhibit ingenuity and outstanding craftsmanship in published media. Y& R SA's Mandevu Beard Care Beard Balm 'Indian', 'Kenyan', 'Kenyan 2' and 'Englishman' campaign made it onto the Cosmetics & Toiletries shortlist, with additional work by Creative Y&R Nairobi.
