Cannes Lions 2017 jurors announced, include 10 South AfricansThe jurors for Cannes Lions 2017 have been announced and include 10 South African creatives...5 May 2017 With international award season in full swing, I asked this year&#x2019;s jurors what makes Cannes Lions stand out to them over the numerous other award shows, why being appointed as a Cannes judge is a career bucket list item, and the sizzle factor that makes work in their specialised category stand out. Jenny Ehlers, ECD at King James Group and design juror. Ehlers responds below&#x2026; Explain why being appointed as a Cannes Lions judge is a career bucket-list item. The Cannes Lions are the ultimate creative awards and rated amongst the most prestigious in the world. Being chosen to sit on the design jury is intimidating given the company of my fellow jurors, however I am extremely honoured to have been selected. What makes Cannes Lions stand out to you over the numerous other award shows? The vast number of entries from across the world and the diversity of the judging panel. It will be fascinating and challenging as a jury member to be immersed in work spanning so many different cultures. What&#x2019;s the sizzle factor that&#x2019;ll make something stand out to you in judging that work? As judges we are always seeking uniqueness, something that is of course relevant and beautifully executed, but also that surprises us and instils envy, in a good way. Which areas do you predict SA agencies&#x2019; work will excel in this year, and why? It&#x2019;s difficult to say, but I'm confident that our South African agencies will represent, our work is consistently of a world-class standard. We&#x2019;re all holding thumbs! The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity 2017 takes place from 17&#x2013;24 June 2017, with Cinemark the local representatives of Cannes Lions for SA.
