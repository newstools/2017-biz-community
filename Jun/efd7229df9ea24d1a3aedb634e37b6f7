When South Africa&#x2019;s largest cider brand wanted to launch their new cider with hop extract, EDGE, to the market they turned to packaging specialists, Just Design, to deliver them a premium stand-out design for this category ground breaker. Balancing the brand&#x2019;s existing visual language with new beer inspired elements Just Design had to ensure that the packaging was truthful to both the intrinsic and the brand to meet consumer expectations. From the hand-drawn hop illustration and sophisticated blue and gold colour palette, through to the heraldic use of the crest and detailed line-work, EDGE combines the refreshment cues from the Hunter&#x2019;s master brand with design language from the beer category to create a new endorsed brand combining the best of both beer and cider. EDGE is in-store now and is available in 330ml NRB, 440ml can and multi-packs. About EDGE EDGE is an innovative, new hybrid category breaker in South Africa.
