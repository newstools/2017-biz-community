Kyle FindlayThe winners of WARC&#x2019;s annual global Admap Prize 2017, an essay contest that encourages and rewards individual excellence in strategic thinking in brand communications, are revealed. Based on the topic &#x2018;How Should TV and Social Media Be Used to Maximum Effect?&#x2019; entrants were asked to address the current re-evaluation by many brands on how traditional media and new media fit together in the marketing landscape. Colin Grimshaw, editor of Admap, organiser of the prize says: &#x201c;We are delighted with the response to this year&#x2019;s Admap contest, now in its sixth year. We were impressed by the volume and quality of the essays submitted based on the topic motivated by P&G&#x2019;s famous declaration last year of an about-face in its marketing strategy, which has prompted many brands into re-thinking their ad budgets.&#x201d; Mandy Pooler, chief marketing officer for Kantar, sponsor of the Admap Prize, comments: &#x201c;It is established that multichannel campaigns are more effective than single-channel, yet how brands marry TV and social continues to be a challenge. Knowledge of exactly how people consume media and subsequently act is key to the solution.&#x201d; Judged by a panel of the industry&#x2019;s foremost thought leaders, seven winning authors were selected offering widely different solutions. Commenting on this year&#x2019;s essays, judge Gemma Craven, SVP, Director Social & Mobile of McCann New York says: &#x201c;The Admap Prize topic is one of the primary challenges facing our industry today. The essays were thought-provoking, diverse and very well researched. There were different opinions on how TV and social should work together, but the clear message was that we spend much time on short-term, knee-jerk approaches to creating buzz and much less time on building long-term success via well-structured programmes.&#x201d; Winning Gold and a $5,000 prize cheque, Thomas Henry, Senior Strategist at Mother New York, USA, in his top award-winning essay titled &#x2018;Why we&#x2019;re all wasting our time&#x2019;, comes down forcefully on the side of TV over social for long-term brand growth. Admap Prize judge Jason Burby, President of Americas at Possible says: &#x201c;Whether you believe that TV is the core and future of all marketing, the Gold Award-winning essay tells a compelling story about marketers over-focusing on short-term wins at the expense of considering long-term brand growth. It reminds us that no matter the channel, we as marketers must be focusing on the long-term impact, and that a combination of TV and digital channels leads to improved performance and impact.&#x201d; The six other winners of the Admap Prize 2017 are: Silver Award: Kyle Findlay of Kantar Innovation, South Africa, for &#x2018;Holistic strategies require a bird&#x2019;s eye view&#x2019; Bronze Award: Matthew Turner, United Kingdom, for &#x2018;Social is the solution to marketing&#x2019;s esprit de l&#x2019;escalier moments&#x2019; Bronze Award: Charlie Ebdy of Vizeum, United Kingdom, for &#x2018;Screen Wipe: Why social media is slowly killing TV and how it could help transform advertising for the better&#x2019; Three Judges&#x2019; Commended Awards are awarded to: Gareth Price of The Social Partners, United Kingdom, for &#x2018;Bridging the gap between activation and fame&#x2019;; Jon Reay of e3 Media, United Kingdom, for &#x2018;Standalone TV ads are nothing than creative indulgence&#x2019;; and Satish Pai, India, for &#x2018;The tipping points&#x2019;.
