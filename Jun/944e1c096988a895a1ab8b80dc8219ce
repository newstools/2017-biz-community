There are baboons in the area that like to steal food and can be quite aggressive about it. So ladies, take care and make sure you pick a safe picnic spot, there are a lot of guides around to let you know where the best spots are. Laid back Franschhoek If you and your circle of friends are in the mood for something more laid back with a picturesque village setting, Franschhoek is the perfect place for your lady-squad. It&#x2019;s tram time The Franschhoek Wine Tram hop-on-hop-off tour is one of the best ways to discover all there is about the wine in Franschhoek. A mix of tram and tram-buses takes you on a loop of stops allowing you and your ladies freedom of choice. Each tram line is colour coded and ticket prices vary. Downtime downtown Downtown Franschhoek is a smorgasbord of restaurants, and if you are a super organised lady you can find them all online so you can pick your passion. There are also gourmet food tours and wine tastings downtown, and if you prefer browsing don&#x2019;t miss the Saturday market in the park. Guilt free wine-xercise Right, let&#x2019;s get down to it gals. If you are one of those ladies who can&#x2019;t stand the thought of consuming that many empty calories, fret not! Franschhoek is one of the most picturesque towns for cycling if you like a bit of exercise between activity spots. Finding a bike is easy, all you need to do is go to the bike rental shop which is a three-minute walk up the road towards the direction the bus came in. It&#x2019;s on the same side as the tram ticket office. In the bicycle shop, you can get a map of the area and recommendations on which wine farms are closest to town.
