It&#x2019;s moments like these that adrenalin-seekers crave when booking an adventure holiday. For exciting thrills and spills, the historic town of Livingstone in Zambia, is the perfect vacation-destination. It has more than its fair share of activities guaranteed to elevate pulse rates to the next level and is not known as Africa&#x2019;s &#x201c;Adventure Capital&#x201d; for nothing! Looking for ideas for your next heart-stopping &#x201c;that-was-insane!&#x201d; holiday? Here are a few suggestions: 1 &#x2013; Whitewater rafting The lazy Zambezi upstream from the Victoria Falls gives no hint of the washing-machine-on-spin-cycle tumbles that lie ahead for whitewater rafters in the Batoka Gorge. Rated by the fraternity as &#x201c;the wildest one-day whitewater run in the world&#x201d; it&#x2019;s an adventure to be enjoyed by beginners and experts alike. The names of some of the rapids give a clue of what to expect: Stairway to Heaven, Devil&#x2019;s Toilet Bowl, Washing Machine and Double Trouble. Thrill-seekers will not be disappointed. 2 &#x2013; Abseiling Descend the sheer walls of the Batoka Gorge that looms above the mighty Zambezi River, downstream from the Victoria Falls &#x2013; one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. The average height of the cliffs is 111 metres &#x2013; providing a thrilling descent down to the base of the Gorge. Wannabe rock-rabbits have a variety of packages to choose from &#x2013; half-day, full-day or a single abseil. 3 &#x2013; Jet Boat High-velocity turns in narrow-river gorges, intense G-forces, getting completely drenched &#x2013; that is what the Jet Boat Excursion has in store. Passengers on the thrilling joy-ride feel the full G-force of around 8 G&#x2019;s as the craft&#x2019;s 700hp twin-turbocharged engines accelerate upstream. Holding-on-for-dear-life and nerves of steel are required as the pilot reaches speeds of 100 km/h, performs 360-degree spins and more. Shooting through &#x201c;The Bath&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Shower&#x201d; rapids will leave you soaked and yelling for more! End the thrilling adventure with an optional 15-minute chopper trip which swoops upstream just above the water&#x2019;s surface and treats passengers to a glorious view of the Falls before landing at the helipad. It&#x2019;s an extreme experience not-to-be-missed. 4 &#x2013; Bungee jumping There is no grey area when it comes to bungee jumping. You either love it&#x2026; or not. The Victoria Falls Bridge (which links Zambia and Zimbabwe) is the launching pad for diving into thin air and plummeting 111 metres towards the swirling Zambezi River below. One can choose between jumping alone or tandem with a friend, or do the bridge swing &#x2013; which entails leaping feet-first in an upright position and then swinging in a huge arc savouring the post-adrenalin rush. 5 &#x2013; Microlight Flight over Victoria Falls Floating and swooping through the sky in a microlight provides the ultimate bird&#x2019;s eye view of Victoria Falls and Batoka Gorge. Some describe a microlight as a &#x201c;lawnmower with wings&#x201d;; it&#x2019;s just you, the pilot, the wings, metal frame, engine and the incredible rush of air as the microlight becomes airborne. Letting your feet dangle over the sides and spreading your arms wide will add to the thrill as you view the wildlife and scenery below. There are different packages to choose from and flights are subject to weather conditions. Proviso: If you have a fear of heights &#x2013; this may not be for you.
