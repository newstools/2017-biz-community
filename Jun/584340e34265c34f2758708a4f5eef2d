Imported from the United States of America, the company's latest product is quadruple distilled, using "the finest grain and natural water for liquid quality". The brand says its focus is on using only what is essential and removing that which is not, to achieve the ultimate level of purity. "Single Batch has been launched in a bold, contemporary pack alongside a strong communications strategy. The packaging, marketing activity and how the brand shows up in a social setting is expected to be disruptive," said the company. The new premium vodka joins Edward Snell & Co.&#x2019;s line-up of spirit brands from around the world, which have been available in South Africa since 1848. Single Batch is available in a case configuration of 6 x 750ml from RRSP 179.99/bottle.
