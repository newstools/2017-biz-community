Criteria The event organisers are looking for the true adventure riders of Southern Africa. Men and women who don't shy away from physical and mental challenges, who are curious, can take the initiative and function as part of a team. It's not a race or a rally. Quest is first and foremost an extremely tough adventure expedition. However, it will include elements of competition where participating teams will be tested on their adventure motorcycle riding and mechanical skills, as well as their endurance, courage and resilience against what Africa has to offer. The main aim of the event will be to test human endurance and adaptability, combined with the continent-crossing abilities of the Honda CRF1000 L Africa Twin. After receipt of the entries, Honda Motorcycles South Africa and Specialised Adventures, organisers of Quest True Adventure, will select 40 applicants to attend Quest boot camp at the beginning of August. Here the instructors will select the final 20 participants, who will then be flown to Namibia at the beginning of September where they will undertake a challenging 12-day, 2500km off-road expedition in the northern parts of Namibia. Costs and logistics Participation is free. However, if you are selected for the boot camp you will need to travel to Cape Town. If you are selected as one of the 20 finalists, transport there and back will be provided. Prize The winning team will each win the Honda Africa Twin CRF1000 L that they used during the Quest event.
