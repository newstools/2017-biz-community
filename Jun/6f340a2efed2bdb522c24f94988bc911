Societal and cultural influence gained the judges&#x2019; favour Historically, the performing arts have inspired action and infuse strength to act upon the art's message when they couldn't deliver it in words themselves. This was the narrative that echoed throughout the evening&#x2019;s performances and award categories, as judges celebrated those artists and productions that proved a catalyst for discussions around change, cut across racial, cultural, social, educational, and economic barriers and enhanced cultural appreciation and awareness. "We made a strong statement in support of LGBTQ rights with a special arrangement of John Lennon&#x2019;s &#x201c;Imagine&#x201d;, led by Timothy Moloi and 10 of our very best voices in harmony," shared Naledi Executive Director Dawn Lindberg. The judges went into raptures over the ground-breaking African musical, TAU, which won in the categories &#x2018;Best Ensemble&#x2019; and &#x2018;Best Original Choreography&#x2019; for Nhlanhla Mahlangu. While, Pay Back the Curry, an acerbic look at South African society, written by the celebrated Mike van Graan and performed by comedian Daniel Richards earned a &#x2018;Best Newcomer Award&#x2019; for the versatile Richards. I See You, a hard-hitting South African play about police corruption and brutality, which was produced by the Market Theatre in collaboration with the Royal Court Theatre in London, won favour with the judges with two awards, including &#x2018;Best Lead Performance in a Play&#x2019; (Male) going to Desmond Dube. Porselein a bold, abrasive, in-your-face Afrikaans production that did not hold back on its punches and hammered home its message in no uncertain terms was acknowledged when Tiaan Slabbert was given an award for &#x2018;Best Supporting Actor&#x2019;. Veteran South African playwright Paul Slabolepszy received an award for &#x2018;Best New South African Script&#x2019; for Suddenly the Storm, while Ameera Patel (&#x2018;Best Supporting Actress&#x2019;) and Ilse Klink (&#x2018;Best Lead Performance in a Play&#x2019;: Female) won awards for their contribution to Scorched.
