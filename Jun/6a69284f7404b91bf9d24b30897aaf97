My photograph &#x2018;Get lost in pretty places&#x2019; captures the yellow-green Autumn hues and was taken at a moment when I felt completely inspired. The scene tickled my senses and I felt as though I could get lost in it for hours,&#x201d; said Hutton. &#x201c;Having grown up on a farm in the Karoo, I feel most inspired when surrounded by beautiful natural places. My passion for photography allows me to showcase my appreciation for nature, creativity and the outdoors. It brings me great joy and allows me to bring joy to others.&#x201d; Clifford Wort Clifford Wort, the winner in the Instagram photographers category, said he was grateful to Lourensford for selecting his image as the Autumn winner. &#x201c;The scene of the yellowing vines and the strong mountain in the background grabbed my attention immediately. The light was ever changing because of the clouds, so it was a real challenge to capture the moment,&#x201d; said Wort, who shot the image on a Canon 7D Mark II with a Sigma 18-250mm lens.
