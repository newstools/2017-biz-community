When a piece of film is good, Johnson tries to work out what it is that draws her in. "Is it the words in a great script that make me watch more, or the beautiful, uncomfortable images that make me listen to the words? When I can&#x2019;t decide, I know it&#x2019;s a goody. "In this case everything comes together beautifully. From the raw narration to the combination of long, composed shots and fluid observational moments, all suspended in a meticulously paced edit and beautifully crafted soundtrack. I like that the visual interpretation of the script is not as literal as it might have been. It&#x2019;s also deliciously textural and kind of awful at the same time. The end sequence of the little boy in the surf at sunrise is sublime. Besides feeling like you&#x2019;re on the surfboard with him, the ending delivers the perfect redemptive note to the story. Always good. Well done Dirk Van Niekerk, 7Films and all involved. Jealous!"
