Over the next eight weeks, Rolls-Royce will announce which great Phantoms will journey to London from around the world, telling the stories of these motor cars and the historical events they witnessed. The first story will chronicle &#x2018;The Fred Astaire Phantom I'. &#x2018;The Great Eight Phantoms&#x2019; From its debut in 1925, a Rolls-Royce Phantom has stood as witness to history&#x2019;s most defining moments, from treaty signings to occasions of state and the events that have defined the world we live in today. To celebrate this unprecedented legacy, Rolls-Royce will bring together the most famous examples of all seven previous generations of Phantom at the exhibition from 27 July 2017. The first of these iconic stories is about &#x2018;The Fred Astaire Phantom I&#x2019;, which is loaned to the Exhibition by its owner, the Petersen Museum in Los Angeles. Rolls-Royce Phantom history Rolls-Royce began producing the Phantom I in 1925. The car was developed in great secrecy, with the project code-named Eastern Armoured Car. This suggested Rolls-Royce was intent on producing the kind of military vehicles used in the First World War, most famously by Lawrence of Arabia. Sections of armour plate were left lying around the factory to confuse curious competitors eager to glean the secret of making the &#x2018;best cars in the world&#x2019;. The Phantom I was an instant success. The new 7.668-litre straight-six engine gave the car a fresh spring in its step. When General Motors opened a testing ground in Michigan, it was discovered that no cars could manage even two laps of the 4-mile circuit at full throttle without damaging their engines big ends &#x2013; where the piston attaches to the crankshaft. However, Phantom I performed with consummate imperiousness and managed that, and more, at a steady 80mph without failure. Sir Henry Royce&#x2019;s restless desire to, in his own words, &#x201c;take the best that exists and make it better&#x201d; quickly led to the creation of the Phantom II in 1929, this time with a totally new chassis, which significantly improved the handling, as well as a re-designed engine. The next Phantom, the third in the line, was to be Sir Henry Royce&#x2019;s last project. He passed away in 1933, aged 70, about 12 months into the development of this next Phantom. The finished model, with its peerless 12 cylinder engine, was unveiled two years later and production lasted from 1936 until the Second World War. The final chassis was produced in 1941, although the war meant it did not receive its coachwork until 1947. No announcement came about a replacement and it looked as if the Phantom was another victim of the war. In 1950, Phantom IV appeared. The car was originally intended to be a one-off for Prince Philip and the then Princess Elizabeth. However, once seen, a further 17 were exclusively commissioned at the request of other royal families and heads of state around the world. Fitted with a straight-eight engine, it performed superbly at low speeds &#x2013; essential for taking part in ceremonial parades &#x2013; and featured the kneeling version of the famous Spirit of Ecstasy bonnet mascot. The Phantom V was produced between 1959 and 1968 and 516 of this model were made for clients including the Queen Mother, governors of Hong Kong, King Olav of Norway and John Lennon. The long-running Phantom VI (1968-90) carried on the royal connection, notably with the Silver Jubilee Car, a raised-roof version presented to Queen Elizabeth II in 1977 by the British motor industry to celebrate her 25 years on the throne, and later famously used at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. In 2003, a watching world was greeted with Phantom VII, a glowing affirmation of the start of Rolls-Royce&#x2019;s renaissance at his new home in Goodwood, West Sussex. It was sharply contemporary yet timeless in the manner in which it deftly retained Phantom&#x2019;s characteristic aesthetic. It arrived with a 453bhp 6.75-litre V12 &#x2013; enough to propel it from 0-62mph in 5.9 seconds. Production of the Phantom VII ceased thirteen years later at the end of 2016. The exhibition will be the first time that this group of iconic luxury motoring pieces will be gathered under one roof. This particular collection will include some very singular cars, all owned at some point by famous individuals, and having played their part in witnessing the making of world history.
