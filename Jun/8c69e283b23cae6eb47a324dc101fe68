&#x201c;Nando&#x2019;s previously provided its own supplier and logistics service for the restaurant use products that are supplied to all the franchises and certain corporate markets. "Through our new partnership, we will now act as the order taker and consolidator from franchise and certain corporate markets as well as the order placer on South African based suppliers, and thereafter the receiver and title owner of goods ordered,&#x201d; explains Imperial chief strategy officer, Cobus Rossouw. &#x201c;These goods will then be on-sold and delivered to the respective Nando&#x2019;s markets by us.&#x201d; Rossouw says that 208 SKUs (stock keeping units) will be procured from 29 local suppliers. The company will manage an average of 600 pallets of Nando&#x2019;s product per month, moving it through Imperial storage and distribution facilities into the international market. &#x201c;By outsourcing these services to Imperial, Nando&#x2019;s can focus purely on its objective of providing the best flame grilled peri-peri chicken ever tasted to a growing global market,&#x201d; Rossouw says.
