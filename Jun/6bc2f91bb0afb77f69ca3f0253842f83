Launched in partnership with accessories brand Mimco, stylists have hand picked pieces to curate looks and collections that are immediately available to shop online. Together with personalised advice on how to wear items and trends, the platform also offers longer length content pieces such as &#x2018;Five ways to wear this season&#x2019;s scarf&#x2019; and &#x2018;How to dress up a classic loafer.&#x2019; &#x201c;This dedicated digital site revolves around fashion and trends and taking that content and making it shoppable is what makes this partnership important. You see something you love and you are immediately directed to the Woolworths.co.za where you can buy it. Two powerful brands are working together in a clever way,&#x201d; says Elouise Brink, marketing manager at Woolworths Group. In addition to online editorial executions with shoppable newsletters and gifs on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, the stylists will feature in selected Marie Claire print issues. Plans include collaborating with more influencers and expanding the network for clients and advertisers to collaborate on fresh Styled By Marie Claire campaigns and fashion stories driven by e-commerce. Holly Meadows, head of commercial content at Associated Media Publishing says, &#x201c;For the first time, fashion brands can tap into the Styled By Marie Claire network, allowing them to leverage styling expertise, a new audience across multiple platforms and magazine-endorsed original content.&#x201d; &#x201c;The unique to brand content will be connected and relevant to current trends with an opportunity to shop looks and read style advice before purchasing,&#x201d; says Oppel.
