&#x201c;Given the recent credit ratings downgrade and potential impacts thereof it is hard to imagine the national office vacancy rate returning to mid-single digits within the next 24 months,&#x201d; the Association said in a recent research report. Yet, SAPOA believes leasing opportunities still do exist with 23 of the country&#x2019;s 53 office nodes still reporting improved occupancy rates during the first quarter while 22 nodes still have vacancy rates below 8%. In these nodes the use of innovative technologies that keep costs in check will be crucial. Mechanical pipe joining systems Barry van Jaarsveld, Victaulic regional manager for Africa, says mechanical pipe joining systems is one such solution which offers an alternative to the use of flanges or welding to connect piping systems and drastically reduces the time necessary to install and maintain these connections. In commercial buildings &#x2013; such as offices, shopping centres or mixed-use developments - this includes piping systems for heating, cooling, plumbing, and fire protection. Van Jaarsveld says using mechanical pipe joining systems can have a significant impact on construction schedules. &#x201c;Contractors are always under pressure to finish a project in time for a launch date or ribbon cutting ceremony and unplanned stoppages can put increased pressure on schedules and budgets.&#x201d; Van Jaarsveld says pipe joining technology is especially suited to commercial building projects as it can easily accommodate changes in the scope of the project. &#x201c;Unlike a welded system a mechanical pipe joining system can easily be taken apart and the same parts can be reassembled. The initial installation of the Victaulic system is about five times faster than welding, but when welded systems need to be reworked, our system can be ten times faster.&#x201d; The reduction in safety concerns also simplifies maintenance or additions and renovation to existing buildings. &#x201c;As there is no fire risk, the system can safely be installed while other people are still using the building.&#x201d;
