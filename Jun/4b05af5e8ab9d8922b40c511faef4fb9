&#x201c;For the third year running, we are looking to the star ratings &#x2013; for food, service and ambience &#x2013; by the Eat Out audience to determine the Best Everyday Eateries in South Africa. It is also the third year that Mercedes-Benz will sponsor the awards, and we couldn&#x2019;t be more delighted about our ongoing partnership in celebrating local restaurants,&#x201d; says Anelde Greeff, editor-in-chief of Eat Out. &#x201c;In a change for 2017, we have listened to restaurant owners and food enthusiasts who have asked for the experts on our panel of critics to play a bigger role in determining the winners. While in previous years the results were based solely on reader ratings, this year an Eat Out critic will visit each of the restaurants that receive enough high scores from the public to review them and give a star rating. Final scores will therefore be based on a 50-50 composite rating determined by the public and the critics.&#x201d; Best Everyday Eateries Categories The categories for each province that will be included in this year&#x2019;s Eat Out Mercedes-Benz Best Everyday Eateries are: &#x2018;Best Asian Eatery&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Bistro&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Burger Eatery&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Coffee Shop&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Country-Style Eatery&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Indian Eatery&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Italian Eatery&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Seafood Eatery&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Steakhouse&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Food Truck&#x2019;, &#x2018;Best Tapas Eatery&#x2019; and &#x2018;Best Mexican Eatery&#x2019;.
