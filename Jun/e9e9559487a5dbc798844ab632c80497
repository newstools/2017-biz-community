SOUTH AFRICA Top international creatives to head Loeries judging panelsFour global creative leaders are heading for South Africa in August for the annual Loeries Creative Week in Durban. The four will head up key jury panels as well as speak at the DStv Seminar of Creativity...Issued by Loeries 19 May 2017 Lefebure, a Thailand native, was named one of Adweek's &#x2018;Creative 100&#x2019; in 2016 and is heading up the 2017 Loeries &#x2018;design&#x2019; judging panel. She has judged design competitions everywhere in the world apart from Africa, including Cannes Lions, the Clios, D&AD and Spikes Asia. She has also served as president of the One Show design jury, AdFest, and the London International Awards and is a member of the Board of Directors for The One Club in New York, so definitely knows what she&#x2019;s looking for... Congratulations on making the jury! What does this mean to you personally in terms of your career? It&#x2019;s an honour to be recognised and invited to be the design jury president. It&#x2019;s very exciting, and I can&#x2019;t wait to be a part of the entire experience. I&#x2019;m looking forward to being introduced to this part of the world through the perspective of design. The most exciting part for me will be to see the work that&#x2019;s being done in the region and to be fully immersed in the design scene of a place I&#x2019;ve never experienced. In terms of career, I am looking forward to making new connections and friendships. Through judging, you are introduced to new ideas, you have debates, you listen to and see new perspectives. These experiences &#x2018;form&#x2019; you and make you a better designer. What are you most looking forward to from the 2017 Loeries&#x2019; judging experience? To really immerse myself in a different culture is such an exciting experience for me. In terms of design, good design speaks a universal language. Good design transfers across languages and cultures. Still, each place in the world tends to have its own design sensibility. You go to somewhere like Japan, and it&#x2019;s very beautiful, simplistic design. It&#x2019;s the same with Scandinavia. The higher hemisphere even plays into the design. It&#x2019;s much quieter, and the colour palette is much different. Something from Bangkok is more colourful and vibrant. The food there is spicy, and the culture is so colourful. The design is bolder, more vibrant. Culture and where we are in the world is really the lens for how we approach and showcase design. The colour palates are so different! In Thailand, the food is sweet, sour and spicy. The design flavour is also like that. Everything reflects into the world of design. Africa will be the same! I&#x2019;ll get to see new things with a fresh perspective. What&#x2019;s the biggest trend in your specific advertising category that you expect to see from this year&#x2019;s entries? Today, design is much more immersive, and people use the design to fully express their brand personality. Good design has to have longevity. It has to last &#x2014; when you&#x2019;re doing branding, it has to be very well considered. You&#x2019;re not changing your logo. Once it&#x2019;s created, it&#x2019;s there. It&#x2019;s like an architect: Once you build something, it has to last. You have to ask yourself if that design has the ability to stay. The way people design is more complex now, because it&#x2019;s not just about the graphic part. We&#x2019;re designing an emotional journey, and it&#x2019;s all about how people will respond. Consumers are looking to engage with brands before buying, causing an industry shift away from the usual advertising. Now it&#x2019;s about brand experiences &#x2013;that&#x2019;s moved design to the forefront of the consumer&#x2019;s journey. What are you most looking forward to from the Loeries&#x2019; experience, once the judging is over? I&#x2019;m excited to experience the culture and to really immerse myself in the whole &#x2018;Africa experience&#x2019;. I&#x2019;m also excited to connect with other people in the industry. It will be nice to see other jury members that I know already and to connect with new jury members. I&#x2019;m looking forward to going to Cape Town, too. The Loeries is what&#x2019;s bringing me to Africa, so it&#x2019;s a journey that I&#x2019;ll remember forever since it&#x2019;s my first time. The fact that people recognise our work in a part of the world that I&#x2019;ve never even been to is amazing, and I am honoured to be on the jury. Let&#x2019;s hope Lefebure has a truly memorable experience. Keep an eye on our Loeries special section for the latest updates.
