Their actions helped to save the affected areas from further devastation and put on full show, the spirit of Ubuntu for which South Africans are known for,&#x201d; she said. Knysna will require tourism to rebuild The community of Knysna and the entire Garden Route region, she added, remains dependent on tourism to thrive and survive and now it will require tourism to rebuild. One of the many attractions and experiences that will go ahead is the annual Pick &#x2018;n Pay Knysna Oyster Festival from 7-16 July 2017, which offers food lovers and sporting enthusiasts a bonanza of fun activities. This festival warms up every winter with food and wine-related events, off-the-wall sports and adventure, and fun activities for the whole family - helping travellers to do tourism and contribute to the restoration of the town. The organisers, along with Knysna Tourism, have assured festival-goers and tourists that they will be able to find accommodation and plenty of things to do and see, in around the town.

Efforts from SA Tourism&#x2019;s side would be geared towards reassuring local tourists that it is back to business for the tourism region. &#x201c;Domestic tourism is a key driver of tourism growth in South Africa. We need local travellers to support the region&#x2019;s tourism products and offerings, allowing them to get back to business because, now more than ever, the town and its surrounds require the income and business.&#x201d; During this time, he adds, South African Tourism plans on allocating a fair portion of its marketing investment to drive tourism communication and marketing activities to Knysna, focusing on key attractions and also, the lesser known places and offerings. We Do Tourism: There are some things locals can and should do to help: Don&#x2019;t cancel your plans: School holidays (inland) are looming and the much-loved town has always been a favourite for families with young children. It is also a favourite for lovers of the outdoor and small coastal town experiences. Do not cancel plans and if you didn&#x2019;t have plans, put Knysna on your itinerary. Play your part: Be a tourist, but also be a model citizen.
