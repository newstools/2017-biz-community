Phillip Oosthuizen, Head of Research and Economics, Sernick GroupNick Serfontein, chairman of the Sernick Group saw the opportunity to better understand the mechanics in the feedlot from a scientific point of view and granted Oosthuizen and the University of Free State the opportunity to establish a feedlot experiment on Sernick&#x2019;s premises in 2015. Serfontein&#x2019;s sentiment has always been that &#x2018;you can&#x2019;t manage what you don&#x2019;t understand, you can&#x2019;t understand what you don&#x2019;t measure, what you don&#x2019;t measure you can&#x2019;t control&#x2019;. Oosthuizen who pioneered the study, begun his tertiary education at the University of the Free State after matriculating from Voortrekker High School in Bethlehem. After completing his BSc in Animal Science and Agricultural Economics in 2013 he went on to acquire his honors and in 2015 he enrolled to obtain his Masters in Agricultural Economics. Improving precision farming and feedlot profitability During 2016, Veeplaas exclusively published the findings on the feedlot experiment conducted by Oosthuizen and the University of the Free State &#x2013; a topic that has garnered much debate among organisations and individuals on various levels. Such specific measurements would ideally play a significant role in the profitability of a feedlot as well as the marketability of a specific breed. Oosthuizen&#x2019;s study aimed to determine the profit maximising feeding period for different breeds of beef cattle in the feedlot. The data acquired was analysed and used to improve precision farming which in turn improved feedlot profitability. Aside from his duties as head of research and economics, Oosthuizen will continue his studies and work towards completing his doctorate. &#x201c;My thesis is still in the planning phase, but the studies&#x2019; objectives will be finalised soon. The current draft includes determining the optimal feeding period for different breeds of beef cattle fed different feed rations in terms of energy and roughage content. Additionally, fat deposition, ultrasound scanning, carcass grading, carcass cut analyses and meat quality will be done to incorporate into the model and the study.&#x201d; Serfontein motivates Oosthuizen&#x2019;s appointment by quoting Edmund Burke&#x2019;s statement that &#x201c;you can never plan the future by the past&#x201d; and believes that the appointment of Oosthuizen will enable the Sernick Group to continuously challenge the status quo to set new measures.
