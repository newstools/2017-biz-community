What does this mean to you personally in terms of your career? Wow, it means a lot to me. I feel very honoured to be selected not just for the jury but to be a jury president. It&#x2019;s great and I&#x2019;m looking so forward to this! It will also be a big point in my career, and I hope I&#x2019;ll meet the expectations. We're sure you will. What are you most looking forward to from the 2017 Loeries&#x2019; judging experience? As I said, I believe the standard of the African and Middle-Eastern creativity is extremely high. So I hope to see a lot of fresh and highly creative cases that might not have been seen in the big global award shows. And &#x2013; of course &#x2013; having a lot of fruitful discussions around them. I mean, the best our small, worldwide creative community can do is to collaborate with each other and get inspiration from all over the world; to get out of &#x2018;the box&#x2019;. What&#x2019;s the biggest trend in your specific advertising category that you expect to see from this year&#x2019;s entries? Technology, storytelling, craft and the combination of those. These days, we have so many new possibilities to be creative and there are so many new ways of telling a story. We&#x2019;re in a time where we can redefine creativity in advertising through technology, new platforms or human behaviours. It&#x2019;s a really exciting time, so I hope to be overwhelmed by the new solutions that have been found for conventional briefings. What are you most looking forward to from the Loeries&#x2019; experience, once the judging is over? I can&#x2019;t say&#x2026; simply because I expect the unexpected! Here&#x2019;s hoping we exceed those expectations! Remember that ticket sales are now open for Loeries Creative Week Durban, taking place from 14 to 21 August 2017.
