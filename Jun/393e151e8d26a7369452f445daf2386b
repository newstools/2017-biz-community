The R1bn development comprising approximately 36,000m2 of lettable commercial space and 4,000m2 of lettable retail space - with a gross building area of approximately 85,000m2 - is currently under construction with the basement structure nearing completion. According to Adhir Imrith, senior engineer and Arup project manager, Buildings Southern Africa, Arup is providing full multidisciplinary engineering services on the project comprising civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, public health, fire and fa ade engineering, as well as sustainability consulting services for the Green Star-rated development. &#x201c;The Park Square development aims to achieve a four-star Green Star As-Built rating, largely due to energy savings in the HVAC system from the use of thermal ice storage which, in principle, uses half sized air-cooled chillers to efficiently produce ice at overnight off-peak tariffs and assist cooling loads during warmer days,&#x201d; says Imrith. Arup has also been appointed to assist the anchor tenant, Nedbank, in achieving a four-star Interiors Fit-Out rating. Occupation at Park Square is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2018.
