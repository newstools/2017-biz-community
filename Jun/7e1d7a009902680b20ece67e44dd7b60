On this week's #blog - the #elephantcake &#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;from @goodfoodsa #gfws2017 I can't stop talking about, and lots more. Link in bio! #instacake A post shared by Leigh Andrews (@ramblinglitchi123) on Jun 9, 2017 at 9:12am PDT But our favourites also extended to the other delights on offer including the gin-smelling wall, coffee-flavoured kombucha tea, and of course we couldn&#x2019;t resists another taste of the strongest coffee in the world &#x2013; Black Insomnia, based in Cape Town and now making java tracks globally. All images here That's what our GFWS 2017 experience was all about. I'll admit that despite this being my first time at the main expo, I had a better idea than most of what to expect having attended the media launch just a few weeks ago, but seeing it in action at the CTICC was still quite something. There were families galore, so I didn&#x2019;t stand out at all with my mom and dad in tow. Ready, set, go with the 2017 Good Food & Wine Show!Calling all foodies! Fiera Milano Exhibitions Africa held the media launch for the Good Food & Wine Show (GFWS) 2017 at the Pavillion of the Table Bay Hotel last week, and it was a treat for the senses....By Leigh Andrews 16 May 2017 The swarming, chattering, chewing crowds have been confirmed as numbering 27,125 over the three days. This is 5% more than last year, so there&#x2019;s definitely a growing appetite for all things food- and wine-related, despite the rather hefty entry fee of R160 for general tickets and these not being cheapie chips &#x2013; that&#x2019;s a good thing, as the three-day extravaganza is the ultimate showcase for local producers. Foodies on the floor But I digress. We entered to a somewhat overwhelming display of colours, scents and tempting treats to buy with stall keepers happy to provide demos of their products in action. There were basketsfuls to buy but also lots to sample. #GFWS2017: Good brand hunting at the Good Food & Wine Show 2017Not a regular attendee of foodie events, I wandered from the furthest reaches of the CTICC parking to collect my accreditation...By Terry Levin 5 Jun 2017 And oh, did we eat and eat &#x2013; samples of everything from slivers of whisky-coffee fudge to olives stuffed with all manner of edibles, Instagram-worthy delicate raspberry and pistachio macaron minis and larger chocolate-filled sky-blue ones, as well as flaky prawn and salmon spring rolls. All images here All images here My dad said the cakes on display would make Buddy the Cake Boss' cakes look like plain Madeira! There were also chefs aplenty giving demos and walking around. All images here The Marco Pierre White talk was so completely &#x2018;jam-packed&#x2019;, if you&#x2019;ll excuse the pun, that we couldn&#x2019;t even get close to the body-guarded entry, so we were a little star-struck to find that Jenny Morris is just as giggly and &#x2018;yumcious&#x2019; in person, and more than happy to pose for photos with fans near the cookbook corner. Another big hit was the Johnnie Walker Black Label experience, which explained why and how the liquor is made, with the option to sample it neat, on ice, blended with ginger ale and as a cocktail. This is a complex carbohydrate of note with a total of 39 elements blended with the whisky to give it that distinctive taste, a few of which are vanilla, apricot, peaches, apples and other fruits. Speaking of smells, the wine and gin-smelling walls were also a hit, proving an interesting way to interact with the product but quite heavy on the nose. Attendees literally pressed the air puff and placed their noses in the funnel for a strong juniper scent. GFWS really is an experience for all the senses. All images here All images here GFWS will be back in Cape Town in 2018 but is still set to light up the Johannesburg and Durban foodie scene later this year: It&#x2019;ll be at the Ticketpro Dome from Friday, 28 July until Sunday, 30 July and at the Durban Exhibition Centre, from Friday 27, October until Sunday, 29 October. I recommend you book your tickets in advance and take wads of cash with you. Luckily there was an FNB mobile ATM near the food truck section at the Cape Town version for those who didn&#x2019;t plan ahead!
