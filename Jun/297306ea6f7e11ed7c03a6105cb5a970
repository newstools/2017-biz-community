In this fluid industry, it is essential that industry pillars recognise the need for ongoing development and robust recognition for those people who are showing talent in the media industry &#x2013; both as an inspiration to future talent and an ongoing guide for the industry as a whole.&#x201d; How to nominate a Rising Star or Legend Potential rising stars (must be over 40 years old) and legends from media agencies or media owners can be nominated through the online survey. One may vote for anyone in the media industry including people who work for one&#x2019;s company. The only people excluded from nomination are those who have won the award previously. The award ceremony will be held on Thursday, 14 September 2017 at The Wanderers Club in Illovo, Johannesburg. Voting for the 9th annual Most Awards will continue until Friday, 30 June 2017.
