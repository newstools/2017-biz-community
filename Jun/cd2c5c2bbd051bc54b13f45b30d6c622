"Old American Radio Stations ... there goes our culture," the DJ said. Black Coffee's comments sparked a debate on Twitter after he was accused of "pushing hate" . He said music has a culture, which would be negatively impacted by the flood of international music on radio. As the tweet got more traction, Black Coffee's cyber army jumped into the conversation and voted for the 90% quota to stay. The local content quota was reviewed shortly after former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng was suspended. An interim board discussed the reversal of the controversial quota for several weeks before a decision was made. SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said the board decided to revert to the directive set by Independent Communications Authority of SA, which determines how much local content is played. "The board was guided by the principles made by Icasa. We wish to also make it clear that the SABC is not anti-transformation; the decision is to play as much local music as possible," he said.
