For one, we've seen how our customers are becoming a lot more informed. They have access to statistics, technologies and information at the click of a button that can display a plethora of current, relevant data on the market in which their home is located. Banks, bond originators and the media release information almost weekly on the trends of the industry, identifying the demand areas as well as informing consumers on the pros and cons of certain investments empowering the man on the street. This is fantastic! Therefore, it is crucial that real estate companies have extensive internal training structures of the highest standard in place to ensure they are equally if not more informed than their clients, that they are able to identify trends in their specialist areas before they even occur, that they can confidently offer clients accurate insights into the transaction and have the answers to the tough questions. When these programmes are in place, the evolution of the market does not intimidate your business but rather excites you at the possibilities.
