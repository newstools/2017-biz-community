Warehouse Theatre, Windhoek, Namibia.The Financial Literacy Initiative, FabLab, Team Namibia and the Namibia Business Innovation Institute (NBII) are hosting this first startup festival. The event is co-sponsored by the German Federal Government.&nbsp; Start-ups are the seeds of a strong economy, with jobs for everyone. In Namibia, there are not enough start-ups, but a lot of tenderpreneurs. This needs to change. Start-ups create jobs, not only for our generation, but our children and grandchildren. They put competitive pressure on existing businesses, forcing them to modernise and innovate, which is very important for long-term sustainable economic growth, stated a press release on the event from The Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany - Windhoek. Over the two days, international speakers will share their experiences. At the festival, participants have the opportunity to learn how to start a business, to secure start-up funding, to finding an investor and to deal with tax issues.&nbsp; The opening keynote will be held by the First Lady and founder of the 1Economy Foundation, Monica Geingos. There will be workshops, panel discussions and time to meet new business partners, sort out start-up finances and take businesses to the next level. &nbsp; Start-ups which are actively working on a business idea can register as &#x2018;Rockstars&#x2019;on&nbsp;NamibiaStartUpFestival.com. All selected startup Rockstars will be invited to partake in the festival's ADDventure business idea pitching competition, where the winner walks away with a cash prize of N$ 75,000. &nbsp; Future entrepreneurs who dream of starting their own business can buy a ticket for the festival as a &#x2018;Rising Star&#x2019; for only N$ 200 only.
