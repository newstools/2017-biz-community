Llewellyn TerblancheTractor would like to introduce Tractor Transit, which will be headed up by Llewellyn Terblanche. &#x201c;We are really pleased and excited to have someone of Llewellyn&#x2019;s calibre and experience joining our team," says Simon Wall, Managing Director of Tractor Outdoor. "Having previously worked for Nfinity Media and Ad Outpost, he has many years&#x2019; experience in the OOH field and we are confident he is the best fit to not only help us drive this separate division of the Tractor Group, but also provide you with the level of service you expect of our company.&#x201d; Tractor Transit will focus exclusively on transit media offerings and will service the whole of South Africa. Tractor Outdoor will no longer be dealing with transit offerings going forward, as this has been spun off to focus solely on billboard mediums.
