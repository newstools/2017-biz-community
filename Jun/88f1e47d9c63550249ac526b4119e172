The World International MXDN event will take place at Farleigh Castle in the UK in September this year. Sponsors RwandAir covers 22 cities in Western, Central, Eastern and Southern Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. It comes on board to cover all the airline tickets for the team. The other significant cost factor is the shipping of the valuable collection of the pre-1986 motocross race machines, equipment, parts, tyres, tools, and accessories. A partnership with World Net Logistics has put the team&#x2019;s minds at rest. World Net Logistics is a dynamic international freight and logistics service provider. In addition to its own branches in Africa, Europe and Asia, it is part of an international network consisting of more than 500 offices with over 30 000 logistics experts&#x2019; worldwide. The third co-sponsor, Global ASP Limited, a specialist technology company supplies all MX race motorcycles every year, along with all the backup support for the team. The company&#x2019;s founding shareholder, Gavin Williams, also acts as the team&#x2019;s manager. Tork Craft a leading power tools and accessories brand in South Africa has been the team&#x2019;s long-term supporter over the years covering all the marketing, reporting, media communication, media, and TV liaising costs, plus numerous other requirements. &#x201c;This year&#x2019;s team is possibly the best team we have ever entered in this tough event, the sponsors have really made it possible for all of us to race in this event in September,&#x201d; said Springbok and multiple national champion, Ryan Hunt. &#x201c;We are still, however, short of a sponsor to cover the transport, accommodation, entry fees and insurance,&#x201d; he says.
