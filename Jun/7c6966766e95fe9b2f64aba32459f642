Saskia CilliersCilliers has a B.Com degree from Pearson Institute. &#x201c;I have always dreamed of a globally recognised degree and pursuing international work experience and this is certainly a stepping stone towards achieving this,&#x201d; says Cilliers. &#x201c;With Cardiff being a hub for international students, my goal is to gain exposure to as many different views of the world as possible, and then to bring new ideas back to South Africa, so that I can increase my value-add for any company I may join in the future. &#x201c;I want to explore Welsh living and I look forward to visiting the St Fagans Museum - an open-air Museum that chronicles the historical lifestyle, culture and architecture of the Welsh people, as well as the Cardiff Castle and the Welsh countryside.&#x201d; To qualify for the scholarship to Cardiff Metropolitan University, Cilliers obtained an average of 65% for all of her modules, in all three years of her studies. She also had to present a motivation letter explaining why she wanted to study abroad, what skills and knowledge she wanted to gain during the postgraduate studies and how she saw that being applied in the workplace, when returning to South Africa. Her final hurdle was a gruelling panel interview. Jansen Van Vuuren, commercial director, Pearson Institute says, &#x201c;Congratulations to Cilliers, who worked hard for the scholarship. Not only were her academic results more than impressive but her intellectual curiosity made her stand out of the crowd. We look forward to her doing us proud.&#x201d;
