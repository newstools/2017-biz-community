Paul WilkinsA year ago, retired media channel consultant, Paul Wilkins confirmed the sad news that Gordon Patterson had passed away. He commented at the time: "Despite being a competitor, he was always a good friend - in fact, a great friend." Now, Wilkins himself has passed away following a battle with cancer. Ann Nurock, former CEO of Grey SA shares:Paul and I were business partners for many years, but more importantly, great friends. While we lost touch over the past few years, I will always remember him as a larger than life, amazing human being who will be missed but never forgotten.Trevor Ormerod, GM group sales and marketing at Times Media until last year, comments from overseas: Paul was a long-term friend and mentor. We spent many hours discussing not just media, but also life and took lots of client trips overseas together. Paul was full of life, fun, passion; a true media man who will be sorely missed and never forgotten. RIP my friend. SA media has lost a true doyen. Paul Wilkins died this morning. A very dear friend who will be deeply missed by me & the entire ad industry. Much love to his family.
