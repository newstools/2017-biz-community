Targeting local ISPs whose customers will benefit from fibre-like mobile connectivity, the companies anticipate that offering competitively-priced access to LTE-A will present new growth opportunities. &#x201c;Access to LTE-A on the Rain network is an attractive proposition for ISPs that have identified LTE-A as a driver of business sustainability, through an expanded product portfolio and infrastructure savings,&#x201d; says Murray Steyn, executive head: wholesale at IS. &#x201c;As IS is already integrated into all existing telcos, with a sophisticated billing and management platform that allows ISPs to administer the packages they market to customers, adding LTE-A to their offering will demonstrate their responsiveness to new technologies and consumer demand.&#x201d; An attractive alternative Where there is high-density mobile coverage, LTE-A offers ISPs and their customers distinct advantages over a wired network like ADSL or fibre, particularly for ISPs that wish to deliver services to customers quickly with minimal disruption during installation. As network coverage improves and gigabit LTE becomes a reality, mobile broadband is increasingly an attractive alternative to traditional broadband connectivity. &#x201c;As we invest in the significant undertaking of deploying a new national LTE-A network, we&#x2019;ve partnered with IS to deliver our fixed wireless broadband service, &#x2018;Rain to the Home&#x2019; (RttH) as a Fibre or DSL alternative. We call this &#x2018;fibre in the sky&#x2019;&#x201d;, says Duncan Simpson-Craib, CEO of Rain. &#x201c;As we progress beyond 3G and 4G, there is increasing potential for mobile connectivity to profoundly change how we work, communicate, and socialise,&#x201d; says Saki Missaikos, managing director of IS.
