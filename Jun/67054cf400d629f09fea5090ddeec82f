Launched in 2015, Worx Group started its IMPACT initiatives towards driving the company&#x2019;s ambition to create a group representative of the South African landscape including a number of Enterprise and Supplier Development opportunities. &#x201c;Following on from the ongoing work we have done together with our 2016 Partner La Funk, the addition of Selz Vision as our 2017 partner to the programme adds another exiting opportunity for us to continue our work with young, aspiring entrepreneurs and companies,&#x201d; says John Paul Waites, Worx Group CEO. Selz Vision is a design, branding, corporate gifting and signage company still in &#x2018;launch&#x2019; phase but positioned for growth having gained some traction with a few corporate and government clients to date. &#x201c;This IMPACT partnership gives us great access to resources, infrastructure and support but more importantly it brings access to market through client introductions and a supplier network. Throw in the mentorship with the Worx Group executive and professional teams and possible joint venture projects, this partnership will breathe new life into my company slogan, &#x2018;Realize Your Vision&#x2019;,&#x201d; adds Tlakale. With a fully integrated incubation structure, the IMPACT Enterprise Development programme is a long-term partnership with the purpose of working with real people to take real actions and develop real results. For a full year, young businesses are given full access to infrastructure, including (but not limited to) internal teams, tech, networks, and facilities, giving them the boost they need to help get their business on track. And while we&#x2019;ve invested in the impact this work has on empowerment and development, for us the real goal of the incubation programme is our commitment to genuine transformation. John Paul adds, &#x201c;Real transformation for us has always been much more than codes. It&#x2019;s about spotting talent and enabling it. Working with these young people reminds me of the early days of launching what is now Worx Group over a decade ago. To be able to empower our partners entrepreneurial ambition through our company today gives me great personal satisfaction &#x2013; it&#x2019;s like running a start up all over again but avoiding the clumsy mistakes along the way.&#x201d;
