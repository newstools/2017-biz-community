Safe Eggs are South Africa&#x2019;s only pasteurised eggs and have two major advantages over normal shell eggs &#x2013; namely they are bacteria-free, therefore protect against foodborne illnesses, most notably salmonellosis and secondly, they have an extended shelf life of up to 56 days at ambient temperature. Quantum Foods executive, Adel van der Merwe, says, &#x201c;Eggs are &#x2018;pasteurised for protection&#x2019; using a method of killing any bad bacteria without boiling the eggs, using technologically-advanced heating units ensuring safe eggs, which are produced by hens fed on all grain diet. &#x201c;While normal unpasteurised eggs are safe to eat when fully cooked, pregnant women, children, older adults and those with weakened immune systems that are more susceptible to salmonella infections and will benefit most from choosing pasteurised eggs. &#x201c;Some of our best-loved foods (such as chocolate mousse, lemon meringue, mayonnaise and other bases for other dressings and sauces) require the use of raw eggs in recipes, therefore cooks, caterers, health fanatics, restaurateurs and anyone that uses eggs in a preparation, that will be consumed uncooked will also benefit from using Safe Eggs.&#x201d; The pasteurised eggs are available at various Checkers stores in Gauteng, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.
