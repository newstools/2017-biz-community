Many of Serco&#x2019;s key customers have opened distribution centres in the Eastern Cape region in recent years, resulting in increasing numbers of Serco vehicles on the roads in that area. Said managing director Clinton Holcroft: &#x201c;The depot is small but we are proud that we now have a Serco flag in PE to support our product and customers, and are committed to providing skills transfer and full support to the local team to see the depot flourish and grow.&#x201d;
