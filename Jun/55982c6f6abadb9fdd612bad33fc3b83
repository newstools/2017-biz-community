According to Kobus Blom, a director of FWJK Developments, the R190m sectional title development has been sold on FWJK's co-development at cost basis to a mix of investors and end users seeking out the opportunity to secure brand new offices at cost without developer's profit markup. The prevailing very low vacancy factor in the Ridgeside office estate precinct has reportedly underwritten the sales success of this development. Designed by FWJK's architectural division, the building will offer 8,000m2 of prime sea-facing office space with five parking bays per 100m2 and will have its own cafe. Construction of Ridge 7 will commence in August 2017 and will be complete during the first quarter of 2018.
