Smith reveals the workshop where he creates much of that magic we see on screen. 1. Where do you live, work and play? I live in Gardens, Cape Town and mainly work from home. There&#x2019;s a cult in the apartment across from mine, which makes things pretty interesting. 2. What&#x2019;s your claim to fame? I was in a ska band in high school called Checked Zebra. We were semi-famous in specific areas of the southern suburbs, mainly at Cavendish. One Rand Man wins five Golds and a Silver at The Midas AwardsKing James' One Rand Man campaign for Sanlam won a whopping five Golds and a Silver at The Midas Awards in New York...Issued by Arcade Content 8 Dec 2014 Film-wise, I suppose my claim to fame would be the series, One Rand Man, which has won pretty much every possible award locally and internationally. Apparently, awards are good things. 3. Describe your career so far. I studied at Afda for three years. From there I went on to research for Keith Rose for two years. The man&#x2019;s a crazy genius, naturally. After that I started an aerial business called Big Bird with a friend, while slowly getting into doing behind-the-scenes on big commercials &#x2013; this linked me up with agencies, which in turn started to get me smaller jobs with them. This then progressed me to joining Arcade Content for two years, and then to Velocity Films. I&#x2019;m now freelance. 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. Dogs. All types of dogs. 5. What do you love about your industry? The catering is usually pretty good. 6. What are a few pain points your industry can improve on? There are many issues with our industry, but the biggest issue for me as a young director is the pitching process. It&#x2019;s simply not fair. As directors, we can spend days/weeks working on a pitch, which we may never even have a chance of getting as it&#x2019;s often just a numbers game. SA advertising and film industry in the grips of global struggle against bid riggingAround the world, ad agencies appear to be scooping up production work and taking it in-house to bolster diminishing profit margins...By Bobby Amm, Issued by CPA 12 May 2017 Agencies often abuse this process in more ways than one. Imagine asking three or four editors to edit your ad and then deciding which one to go with. It&#x2019;s the same thing: It&#x2019;s our time, our expertise. There should be pitching fees. That needs to happen. 7. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. The only consistent thing about my work day is that it always starts with a good coffee. 8. What are the tools of your trade? I&#x2019;m also an editor and believe it helps me tremendously as a director, so: my laptop with Adobe CC, Keynote and good internet. 9. Who is getting it right in your industry? DOPs and cameramen &#x2013; I see so many of them doing so well, always busy. It&#x2019;s fantastic. 10. What are you working on right now? I&#x2019;m finishing up a short film called Sea Bones. I&#x2019;m excited to get it out there &#x2013; we&#x2019;re busy composing music with the talented guys at Pressure Cooker Studios at the moment. 11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. I doubt I can use that language in this interview! The things I utter to myself about our industry are generally not very positive. 12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? Early morning and/or while hiking/running. 13. What&#x2019;s your secret talent/party trick? I can touch my nose with my tongue. 14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? Definitely a technophile &#x2013; I love new cameras, lenses, rigs. I always keep track of the latest stuff online. Big Bird, being a high-end, legal aerial company, always needs the latest stuff to stay current, which is an exciting but rather expensive habit. It&#x2019;s always Christmas at Big Bird. 15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Pictures of dogs and screengrabs of interesting new film tech. 16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? Do ads but don&#x2019;t get emotional about them. Don&#x2019;t spend too long on pitches; if you have a good take on their concept that should be the main focus. Rather invest your emotion in to making short films/music videos/passion projects and give yourself a motivation or pressure to do it by a certain time or for something particular. We need to stop waiting for agencies to give us good ideas and make our own. Simple as that.
