In its latest results, Petco reports that the organisation recycled 55% of post-consumer bottle PET, equating to two billion PET bottles collected for recycling across South Africa over the course of 2016 and creating some 62,000 income opportunities. Financed by a voluntary recycling fee paid annually by members, Petco has collected over 500,000 tonnes of post-consumer PET bottles for recycling since its incorporation in 2004, saving almost 800,000 tonnes of carbon and over three million m of landfill space. Scholtz concludes: &#x201c;While this is an extremely proud accomplishment for Petco, we could not have achieved this without the dedicated network of people we work with that have enabled Petco to expand our collection network, build relationships with recyclers, seek new opportunities to develop and support entrepreneurs, and ultimately grow our recycling tonnages.&#x201d;
