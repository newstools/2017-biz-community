And while this auction lot offers endless possibilities for bad puns, &#x201c;the business opportunity here is as serious as a heart attack&#x201d;, High Street lead auctioneer and director Joff van Reenen comments dryly. &#x201c;All jesting aside, the process of obtaining planning permission for a cemetery is a complicated one for obvious reasons, and business opportunities of this nature &#x2013; where all the permits are already in place &#x2013; are as rare as hen&#x2019;s teeth. &#x201c;Private cemeteries are enormously lucrative ventures, though, because the country&#x2019;s general mortality rate is high, there is ever-dwindling space available in existing cemeteries and South Africans predominantly favour traditional burials over cremation.&#x201d; According to SAFuneralPlan.com, the average cost of burial plots nationally is around R12,000, but in areas where supply is low the cost can rise as high as R30,000. &#x201c;On this lot, we&#x2019;ll open bidding at R3 million but do a quick calculation of R12,000 times 12,500 plots and the value proposition becomes a no-brainer,&#x201d; says Van Reenen. &#x201c;As much as one might joke about starting a venture that has an endless number of people dying to get through the door, the fact is we&#x2019;re all mortal and we will pass on sooner or later. &#x201c;I therefore anticipate there&#x2019;ll be fierce bidding on the cemetery lot at the auction on June 29, because the odds of this business being hugely successful are infinitely higher than the chance of it failing.&#x201d; High Street Auction Co. joint managing director Lance Chalwin-Milton says June&#x2019;s auction will be bigger than their most recent bumper sale in May, in which more than 30 lots went under the hammer. &#x201c;On average, more than 90% of our lots comprise voluntary sales, usually by corporate clients reshuffling their portfolios, and the current high stock volumes coupled with competitive bidding indicates we&#x2019;re in a very active market period.&#x201d; He says despite the country&#x2019;s ongoing economic difficulties, the dissolution of assets under bank-instruction as a result of liquidation or sequestration still accounts for less than 5% of High Street&#x2019;s overall auction stock. &#x201c;It goes without saying that the willing buyer/willing seller scenario is always preferable, because even in our economic doldrums it&#x2019;s indicative of a property market that&#x2019;s still relatively far from breaking point,&#x201d; says Chalwin-Milton. The next High Street Auction will take place on 29 June at Summer Place, 69 Melville Road, Hyde Park, starting at noon. For more information visit www.highstreetauctions.com.
