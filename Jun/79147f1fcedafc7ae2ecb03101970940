This is what Michelle Macfarlane, marketing manager of Top T had to say, &#x201c;We have been working with On the Dot since 2015. Vangie Fonseca, our national key accounts manager, goes above and beyond with her service every day. Her kind and caring demeanour means peace of mind at all times. The Media Intelligence Department provides in-depth demographics which enable us to make informed decisions on our distribution choices. The knock-and-drop distribution has resulted in a constant increase in foot traffic over the years. On the rare occasions when we have issues, they are dealt with promptly, professionally and we receive full reports and are notified of corrective action taken."
