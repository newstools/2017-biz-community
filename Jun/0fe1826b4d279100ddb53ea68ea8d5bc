PE GRAFFITI Art See how Joff, PE&#x2019;s very own graffiti artist turns a bare wall into a local Port Elizabeth brag wall. See him actively bring his art to life during Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the show. Graffiti is an up and coming art genre that combats inner city decay. NMMU Design Students The 3rd Year NMMU Design students will showcase their enjoyable and communicative display inspired by the idealistic image of a child's depiction of what a house looks like; a house, hedge and happy clouds. The students then also designed an interactive facade on the house structure that then poses the question "What makes your house a home?" and then an array of answers can be answered by looping colourful wool around the pegs, eventually creating a colourful layered facade. See this display as you enter the 2nd hall from the Food Court. live by DESIGN On the cutting edge of design - find hand-picked collections of on-trend interiors, bespoke d cor from designers and fabric houses, and soft furnishings for your home.
