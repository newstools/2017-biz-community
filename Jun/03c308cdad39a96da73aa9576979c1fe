Jury Chair - 'Social Strategy' category: Quinn Kilbury, Senior Brand Director, Heineken USChaired by Quinn Kilbury, senior brand director of Heineken US, the 17-strong jury panel of senior industry experts looked for campaign strategies that relied on the benefits of particular social platforms - or a combination of those platforms - to fulfil particular business objectives. Additionally, they looked for marketing programmes that were social by design - not simply a small part of a broader marketing initiative - and that made a significant impact on brand performance or influenced consumer behaviour. They were also keen to see campaigns that had effectively deployed newer engagement tools on social platforms, such as chatbots and live video.
