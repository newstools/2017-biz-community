The survey findings revealed that there can be a wide range of labour rates charged; ranging from R300 to R1,000 per hour, depending on vehicle brand or dealer location. The survey has revealed that most expensive brands to service and maintain, (once no longer covered by their maintenance/service plans), are Land Rover, Mini, BMW, Jaguar and Audi while the cheapest are GWM, Cherry, TATA, Foton and Mahindra.
