With the "Lufthansa crewFlight" apps, the seating plan is quickly opened, providing the cabin crew with a plenty of information on the guests of their next flight. The cabin mobile device (CMD) will be successively issued to the entire cabin crew over the next few weeks. The so-called electronic flight bag has already been in operation in the cockpit since the beginning of 2015 and is used by 4,300 pilots for flight planning and operations. At the same time, cabin crew managers also received a tablet, and this is now to be extended to include all cabin crew. The CMD will allow cabin crew members to access all the data they need to work onboard, to access important service manuals and service schedules, and easily view any changes in plans. The project is part of a major current program of transformation called 'OPSession', which aims to further digitise the operational areas of Lufthansa, Swiss and Austrian Airlines.
