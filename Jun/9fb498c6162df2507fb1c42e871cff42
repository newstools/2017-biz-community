&#x201c;Punching above its weight&#x201d; was a common refrain when reflecting on this year&#x2019;s PR award season. The agency walked away with nine awards within a three-week spate, scooping four Gold, one Silver, three Bronze and a Special Mention including the coveted Small Agency of the Year award across local, intercontinental and international award shows (see list below for more details). &#x201c;Taking home four Golds especially for Campaign of the Year in partnership with our client SABRIC for #Skelm and Small Agency of the Year is testament to our purpose of growing clients through brand belief. Authentic brand conversations are absolutely critical to the industry&#x2019;s integrity as well as for the brands entrusted to us,&#x201d; says Managing Partner Keri-Ann Stanton, Engage Joe Public. Keri-Ann was also selected to participate as a juror on the PRISM, SABRE EMEA and Africa Excellence judging panels. Some of her major take-outs from the global and local awards include: Big ideas, creativity and innovation come out tops and get award winning attention. Follow that up with empirical evidence pointing to behaviour change or tangible business results and you get your chance on the podium. Spend time writing, crafting and developing collateral to really make your award entries sing. We work so hard &#x2013; showcase the work properly! </li></li>&#x201c;Networking and interacting with industry peers, where you sit in intense judging sessions for hours debating the nitty-gritty of campaigns and the work that went in to achieve the results, is an eye-opening and personal growth experience that is priceless and will help us grow our clients brands even further,&#x201d; concludes Keri-Ann.
