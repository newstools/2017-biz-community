Make his day with first class whale spotting along the Whale Route. With the southern right whales making their way to the south coast in June, it's the ideal time to pack those binoculars and head to the shoreline: Explore the Jewel of the Cape. De Hoop Nature Reserve, a beautiful Cape Heritage Site approximately three hours&#x2019; drive from Cape Town, promises a rewarding day with full outdoor seashore excursions. For one, you can challenge dad to join in on the Reserve&#x2019;s Whale Trail, a five-day hiking trail offering spectacular views of the Reserve&#x2019;s coast. Rest assured, the trail includes well-equipped accommodation for each night. Celebrating its 10th anniversary year, De Hoop Nature Reserve is making its best offerings accessible for the whole family with discounted winter accommodation rates (1 May to 27 July). Time for a Whale Route pitstop? A few hours&#x2019; road travel can be enough to work up an appetite. On your way to the southernmost tip of Africa, L&#x2019;Agulhas, stop for a decadent meal at Agulhas Country Lodge. Take a &#x2018;selfie&#x2019; with dad against the backdrop of magnificent sea views from the lodge&#x2019;s deck, and enjoy different meal options including traditional country cuisine and fine dining. Add a special touch with cognac and fine Cuban cigars in front of a crackling fire in the cigar lounge. On Father&#x2019;s Day weekend, the lodge is stripping 40 percent from its usual accommodation rates. Break the tension. For many dads (and anyone, for that matter!), the half-year mark can be a checkpoint in a &#x2018;backbreaking&#x2019; journey. Soothe the tension with a well-deserved spa treatment at the luxurious Arniston Spa Hotel. With panoramic views of the Indian Ocean and untouched beaches, its spa therapies make for the perfect Father&#x2019;s Day treat. We recommend the &#x2018;Stress Buster&#x2019; break comprising a few nights&#x2019; stay and spa treatments to refresh and take on the rest of 2017 with new vigour.
