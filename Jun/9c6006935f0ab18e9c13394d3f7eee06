With the companies committed to democratising internet access, the initiative is one of many aimed at strengthening the social fabric of South Africa. &#x201c;South Africa is currently facing difficult times and supporting access to the most affordable data rates is a priority. Wi-Fi provides the platform to get people connected personally and across communities. Understanding the value of connectivity, our business was founded with the objective of driving inclusivity, empowering South Africans with access to meaningful opportunities for education, jobs, business, etc. and enhancing the global competitiveness of our country,&#x201d; said Grant Marais, CEO of VAST Networks. Oone of the most important telecoms markets in the future &#x201c;Pervasive Wi-Fi will have massive implications for Africa; the continent will become one of the most important telecoms markets in the future, and its continued success will depend on investments in wireless systems. Mobility and wireless (particularly Wi-Fi) present a significant opportunity to aid in the socio-economic development of people and businesses &#x2013; particularly as it provides a cost-effective access solution to the current available channels. Expectations are shifting &#x2013; and Wi-Fi&#x2019;s time is now,&#x201d; said Riaan Graham, sales director for Ruckus, sub-Saharan Africa. South Africans are able to access their free 1GB of data at any of the more than 2,000 VAST Networks locations, across the country. To find your nearest hotspot, connect to www.vast.network.
