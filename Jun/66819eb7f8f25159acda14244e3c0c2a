In addition, the new season will probably have its own particular challenges. A late season, pressure at silos to finalise grain deliveries, large quantities of grain with a high moisture content and low prices are some of the challenges which will be faced by the largest part of the summer grain area in South Africa. Primary agriculture will probably outperform the larger economy as far as growth is concerned, but expectations are that the surplus cash will more than likely be used to normalise debt levels. Despite the good crop, it is uncertain as to whether the estimated risk level will return to normal levels. The season following a drought cycle is usually characterised by extensive adjustment of customer issues and excussions of those who did not survive the cycle. Stakeholders, however, can be assured that Senwes will continue with its investment in innovation and integration and that it will increase its relevance in the future even more.
