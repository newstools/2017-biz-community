The cider range: Hunters Dry, Hunters Gold and Hunters Extreme were uniquely presented in outdoor dome structures where concertgoers enjoyed brand engagement. Brand attributes and personality were individually communicated in three zones. Each environment included specific styling details, branding, powerful lighting, specific colour palettes, customised furniture and a service bar. Top SA artists performed centre stage and Hunter's fans participated in exciting activations including cider pong, Instabooth, buzz wire, face painting, t-shirt printing, beat box sounds, a colouring in wall and even live barber services. click to enlarge click to enlarge click to enlarge click to enlarge click to enlarge click to enlarge
