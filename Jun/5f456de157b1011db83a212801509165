The idea has been simmering for a while and after a meeting of the minds with June late last year I decided to create an event - a &#x2018;movement&#x2019; where women can engage and learn from those who have done it before. I am excited to see this platform take shape,&#x201d; said event owner, Carol Bouwer. The panel discussion included Khanyi Dhlomo (CEO Ndalo Media), June Ambrose (American celebrity stylist), Elelwane Mpatlane (Edcon&#x2019;s GM of Transformation) and Anina Malherbe-Lan (Founder of VividLuxury). &#x201c;It is important for us as woman to share our experiences and offer advice to young females who want to pursue their passions,&#x201d; said Malherbe-Lan. June Ambrose&#x2019;s Style Icons gala dinner in the evening was attended by celebrities, including the first lady Bongekile Ngema-Zuma, UDM leader Bantu Holomisa, the MC for the evening, Bonnie Mbuli, Basetsana Kumalo, Rosette Ncwana, Twala Ngambi, Mayor Patricia de Lille and the host for the evening, Carol Bouwer. Quiteria & George launched its new fashion collection; award-winning singer and budding fashion designer, Nlanhla Nciza, from Sama-winning duo Mafikizolo, performed some of the duo&#x2019;s hits, along with a first look at her newly launched fashion line. The African Odyssey was brought to life by partnerships, which included UN Women, Edcon&#x2019;s Orange Initiative, Unicef, Destiny magazine and the City of Cape Town.
