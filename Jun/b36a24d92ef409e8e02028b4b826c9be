That's an incredible saving to local consumers who now have to contend with an economy in recession," says Ongopotse Motlhanke, chief operations officer of Archer Digital. The company's SMS+ service is reportedly already in commercial use by one of South Africa's big four banks and is currently being trialled by a multimedia company. How it works SMS+ takes the conversational element of USSD and adds layers of simplicity and functionality while greatly enhancing consumer-facing reliability. Instead of featuring a transient USSD menu that countless mobile users have seen disappear for no apparent reason, SMS+ does not require new sessions for each new interaction by the user and consumers can store SMS+ messages in their inboxes as useful references. "We expect tremendous uptake for SMS+ from organisations wanting to engage in two-way communication with their customers that offers a degree of intelligence while adding the zero-rated aspect for even greater client service," concludes Motlhanke.
