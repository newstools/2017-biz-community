Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said the public response to the challenge of naming the aircraft after things that captured the spirit of Australia was fantastic. &#x201c;We had so many worthwhile entries, we could have probably renamed our entire fleet of 208 aircraft,&#x201d; Joyce said. &#x201c;There were some clear favourites and it&#x2019;s given us a good mix of names for our eight Dreamliners, from landmarks to native animals, literature and indigenous heritage. &#x201c;We know people get a real sense of home when they see the flying kangaroo at airports around the world, and hopefully they&#x2019;ll enjoy seeing these uniquely Australian names as well,&#x201d; added Joyce. The final names: &#x2022; Great Barrier Reef &#x2022; Boomerang &#x2022; Skippy &#x2022; Waltzing Matilda &#x2022; Uluru &#x2022; Great Southern Land &#x2022; Quokka &#x2022; Dreamtime The names will be painted beneath the cockpit window on each aircraft. The sequencing of names will be revealed as the aircraft are delivered, with the first to arrive in October this year.
