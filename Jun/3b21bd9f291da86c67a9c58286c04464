Cinemark Young Lions' winners, Amri Botha and Carina Coetzee with Lynne Wylie (Head of Marketing at Ster-Kinekor)Local winners of South African Cinemark Young Lions, Amri Botha and Carina Coetzee, from Cape Town-based agency, Ninety9cents, won over the judges with their 60-second commercial focused on cyber-bullying &#x2013; beating 40 other teams. The creative pair produced the commercial from brief to concept, to shooting, editing and final production within 48 hours. Moreover, they must do it all again at the Cannes Young Lions competition in France. The Film Lions celebrate the creativity of the moving image, so the team will need to demonstrate brilliant brand storytelling intended for the silver screen or TV. They will be judged predominantly on idea and execution. The festival will see a diverse community of communications, marketing, entertainment, design and tech talent from 90+ countries worldwide come together to learn, network and celebrate. They team thanked Cinemark for the opportunity of a lifetime. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t believe this is finally happening! Going to Cannes is a dream come true and we want to make South Africa proud! We are ready to roar to victory,&#x201d; they said. &#x201c;This is a life-changing experience and an overload of all things creative. We are 100% behind Amri and Carina,&#x201d; said Motheo Matsau, chief of marketing and sales at Ster-Kinekor Theatres. &#x201c;We look forward to following their first Cannes journey with them. We know they will do their very best to make us proud. After all, Lions belong in Africa.&#x201d;
