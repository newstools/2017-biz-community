Co-located with the well-known Markex expo, now in its 30th year, those arriving at the shows were able to see and touch the hottest in promo products, experience a range of services - from augmented reality to social media in action - take a selfie with the iconic Madex dinosaur and be creative on the official Doodle Wall. Madex ran from 7-8 of June at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg. With a focus on keeping local marketeers up to speed with the fast-paced changes within the industry, visitors were treated to talks by the likes of Joggie Myburgh, who explored the art of bringing storytelling back to B2B marketing, creating and curating &#x2018;sticky&#x2019; content by Daniel Malherbe, and how to optimise marketing efforts across Gen X, Y and Z in South Africa by Monique Claasen. Event organiser, Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery thanked the combined 120 exhibitors at an exclusive function held on the first night of the show at Parc Ferm in Sandton. Exhibitors also received awards for the first time ever, with Amrod taking the title for Markex: most resellers converted, Kevro winning the best Markex overall marketing campaign award, and Mass Supply having the best social media campaign. For Madex, Scan Display win the best social media title, and PocketMedia Solutions the best PR and content award. &#x201c;Congratulations to our winning exhibitors on both shows, we&#x2019;ve seen a tremendous effort this year from all companies involved in raising awareness around Markex and Madex,&#x201d; said Nick Sarnadas, Event Director at Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery.
