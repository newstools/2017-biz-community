Sunu won for directing the music videos and brand films for One Source, Native VML&#x2019;s campaign for Absolut starring Khuli Chana, Sarkodie, Victoria Kimani and other African musicians. &#x201c;For a long time, South African creatives looked overseas for inspiration,&#x201d; says Sunu, who shot One Source in Ghana. &#x201c;In contrast, One Source is a celebration of the creative revolution taking place across the continent as we embrace who we are as Africans. All credit to Native VML, Absolut and Pernod Ricard for seeing the opportunity in showcasing Africa in a completely different light on a global stage.&#x201d; Khuli, Native VML&#x2019;s Jason Xenopoulos and Ryan McManus, and Pernod Ricard&#x2019;s Melanie Campbell presented One Source as a case study on the mainstage during Cannes Lions &#x2013; an honour in itself, considering other speakers included the likes of Facebook&#x2019;s Sheryl Sandberg, Nobel Peace Prize winner Juan Manuel Santos, and stars like A$AP Rocky, Steven Gerrard and Halle Berry. One Source topped South Africa&#x2019;s iTunes charts and was nominated for Best Music Video at The South African Music Awards and Metro FM Awards. The campaign was also the most nominated and most awarded campaign at South Africa&#x2019;s Bookmarks. &#x201c;This was a collaboration of truly talented people,&#x201d; says Egg Films&#x2019; producer Kerry Hosford. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re immensely grateful to have been able to work with a brave agency and client who allowed us to make work that stands out, at a time when so many brands in SA are playing it safe.&#x201d; Going into Wednesday night&#x2019;s awards, Egg Films and their sister company Arcade Content had all seven of South Africa&#x2019;s shortlists in the Entertainment and Entertainment for Music categories at Cannes Lions, as well as the only Media shortlist from South Africa. These converted into a Grand Prix, a Gold, two Silvers, and two Bronzes.
