Lions PR celebrates creative excellence in PR and corporate communications, which successfully builds trust and cultivates relationships with credible third-parties, using mainly earned-media tactics or channels to influence public dialogue and ultimately change perceptions and behaviours in ways that protect and enhance the reputation and business of an organisation or brand with its target audiences. 'Sunlight saves water', created for client Unilever SA's 'Sunlight washing powder with new Smartfoam' by The Hardy Boys, with Ogilvy Johannesburg supporting with PR, made it onto the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods or FMCG PR category shortlist.
