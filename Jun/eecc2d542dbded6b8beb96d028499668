Moyanga has built his business mainly in the East Rand but also spanning Gauteng province and extending into Mpumalanga. His story is one that tells of a proud South African focussed on making a difference in the transformation of this country and in the development of business in his local community. 22 years ago he was one of McDonald&#x2019;s first employees in South Africa and today he is amongst one of the company&#x2019;s 40 franchisees. &#x201c;I have always been an entrepreneur at heart, even when I joined McDonald&#x2019;s as an employee. Its support in the development of its people, whether franchisees or employees, drew me to the opportunity,&#x201d; Moyanga said. McDonald&#x2019;s SA, which opened its first outlet in South Africa in November 1995, says its newly-built restaurant portrays an updated, modern personality for the company. &#x201c;This is a milestone for our business in South Africa,&#x201d; said Greg Solomon, CEO of McDonald&#x2019;s SA. &#x201c;We are proud to be celebrating the opening of our 250th store in a country that we have been creating history in for the past 21 years, a country with a people rich in their culture, pride and a love for good food that is unmatched in the world. What makes this even more special for us; is to celebrate with one of our incredible owner operators, Peter Moyanga, who is opening his ninth McDonald&#x2019;s restaurant.&#x201d;
