The Silo District is developed around the historic grain silo-turned-Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa which is nearing completion and officially opens to the public in late September. The mixed-use space is already home to eateries such as Woolworths&#x2019; Now Now, Sushi Box, the Granary Caf and the Willaston Bar located within the Silo Hotel, as well as a Virgin Active Classic Club. The Lindt Chocolate Studio, which opened in April, provides chocolate-making classes in addition to its retail function. Joining them later in the year will be The Yard, an all-day pan-Asian eatery; Si!, a Spanish and African infused gastronomy pub and audio-visual experts Bang & Olufsen. The new concept Radisson Red Hotel will also open in September. Rahla Xenopoulos, author and novelist, in Kat van Duinen s new designer store. Live, work and play &#x201c;The V&A Waterfront has taken a three-pronged approach to development at the Silo District, focusing on providing a mixed-use space in which people can live, work and play. Our residential and commercial office offerings have been well known for a while, but our lifestyle and leisure plans for the district are also reaching fruition,&#x201d; said David Green, CEO of the V&A Waterfront. &#x201c;With Zeitz MOCAA at its core, we wanted the Silo District&#x2019;s retail offering to reflect the creativity, design, art and culture embodied by the museum. Today&#x2019;s opening is a small teaser focused on our retailers, and a preview of what to expect from our grand opening in September, when Zeitz MOCAA opens to the public and the final few retailers open,&#x201d; concluded Green.
