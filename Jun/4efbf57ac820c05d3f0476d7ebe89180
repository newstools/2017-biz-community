There is a lot in store for DQ&A over the coming year as we take this step to move our brand forward, and differentiate ourselves within the industry. This transformation showcases a new visual identity, designed to reflect DQ&A&#x2019;s professional and innovative character in the digital industry, as well as our continued growth as a business. This new design is really about cutting down on all the noise, bringing in a new level of simplicity, it&#x2019;s all about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful. It was important for us to have continuity between the previous identity and the new, a seamless update with an improved concept. As DQ&A continues to evolve as a business, so will our brand.
