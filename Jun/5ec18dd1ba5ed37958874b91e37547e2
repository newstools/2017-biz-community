The Product Design Lions celebrate creativity that fuses form and function. Entries need to demonstrate aesthetics that are inseparable from application through work that blurs the line between a product&#x2019;s beauty and utility by achieving both. There are 60 entries on the shortlist. Click here to view the Product Design Lions shortlist in full. The Festival of Creativity runs from 17-24 June 2017, with Cinemark the local representatives of Cannes Lions for SA.
