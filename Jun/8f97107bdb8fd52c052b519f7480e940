Uber recently booked a basket of our new digital screens at the forecourts and we are delighted that this client is on our platform. Not only is it a &#x201c;cool client&#x201d; but it is also very relevant to the motoring space. This campaign goes beyond the idea that Uber is for that ad hoc ride to the airport, or back home after a night out with your buddies partying. They are pitching it as an alternative to the second family car, or even owning a car at all. We are watching this space with keen interest to see what innovation they come up with next! We hope to be able to grow our relationship with this client going forward.
