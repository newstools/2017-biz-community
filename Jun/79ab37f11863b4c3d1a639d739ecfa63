Raimund Snyders, CEO of Old Mutual Insure&#x201c;Changing a well recognised and respected brand, such as Mutual & Federal is not something that happens often. The brand history of Mutual & Federal goes back to the 1800s, with this rebrand being another milestone signalling the journey we have been on as a member of the Old Mutual family," Raimund Snyders, CEO of Old Mutual Insure, says. &#x201c;The rebranding process has been managed thoroughly and collaboratively, to ensure a seamless change-over for our employees, advisors, brokers and of course, our customers." From today, the new name and brand will be reflected in all communication with stakeholders. Existing policy schedules and policy wordings will be rebranded when they come up for renewal. It is expected that these changes will take a maximum period of 24 months to be completed.
