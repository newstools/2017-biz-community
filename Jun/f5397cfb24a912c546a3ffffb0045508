Twitter s in-house campaign showed major conversations of the day united by hashtags.Twitter, in the US, won for an in-house campaign showing how the major conversations of the day, in politics and elsewhere, are united by hashtags. Universal Pictures&#x2019; The Secret Life of Pets featured a digital creative treatment from MediaCom and Ocean Outdoor. The award winners were chosen by a judging panel of current and past Fepe board members with Nancy Fletcher, president and CEO of the US OAAA and WCRS director of technology and innovation Dino Burbidge. WCRS won last year&#x2019;s creative award for UK charity Women&#x2019;s Aid. Fepe President Matthew Dearden says, &#x201c;The great strength of OOH is its two important strands: digital and the traditional classic poster and that&#x2019;s why we have chosen to award campaigns in the two categories. &#x201c;Both are outstanding examples of the ability of OOH to reach people in engaging and challenging ways. It&#x2019;s also worth noting that Twitter is just one of many tech-based new media companies that use classic OOH extensively.&#x201d; The Secret Life of Pets - Full Campaign from Ocean Outdoor on Vimeo.

Brian and Mike Tyquin come from an earlier generation but they too have always possessed that same pioneering spirit. Their belief that doing the right thing for the industry would in turn result in commercial success is something that everyone in OOH can honour, as we do in this Lifetime Achievement Award.&#x201d;
