For a decade and a half, South Africa&#x2019;s premier gender parity platform has awarded accomplished women leaders and visionaries across a host of disciplines, whose journeys to success ignite the entrepreneurial spirit of the next generation of women leaders. Previous Top Women award recipients include Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Adv. Thuli Madonsela, Margaret Hirsch and Jol ne Leeuwner-Maritz. The awards&#x2019; categories are comprehensive. Women entrepreneurs being central to the economy&#x2019;s growth, there&#x2019;s an award for the year&#x2019;s &#x201c;Top Young Achiever under 40&#x201d;. Meanwhile, several categories showcase companies or organisations at the forefront of gender parity in their sectors. Top Women being a fully inclusive platform, a special award is also reserved for the &#x201c;Top male driving gender empowerment&#x201d;. In short, there&#x2019;s a Top Women Award for everyone who embodies, or advances, the success of South Africa&#x2019;s women. Entrants&#x2019; nominations are evaluated against strict criteria in order to designate the award finalists, who then undergo further rigorous analysis by the judges in the quest for a coveted Standard Bank Top Women trophy. This year&#x2019;s notable judges include Abigail Khuluse, Busi Selesho, Kate Moodley, Thulisile Phiri, Lullu Krugel, Phuti Mahanyele, Lebo Madiba and Margaret Sibiya. This year&#x2019;s winners will be announced in a lavish ceremony on 17 August at Emperors Palace in Johannesburg. Meanwhile, the journey to that glittering stage begins with the decision to enter. There&#x2019;s still time - but not much. Click here to view the various awards categories, or email az.oc.ocpot&#64;sdrawde.euqilegna . with any enquiries. #Whatsyournext?
