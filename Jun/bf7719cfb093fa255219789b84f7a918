The book is dedicated to all couples who value their marriage enough to bulletproof it and to smart singles who know that prevention is better than cure. As a result of challenges in the first part of their now 26-year old marriage, and years of counselling couples on a wide variety of marital problems, the co-authors Renato and Cristiane Cardoso, realised that the difficulties experienced by most relationships are similar. Another commonality is that people lack skills to resolve them so they keep repeating damaging behaviour, holding on to emotional hurts and communicating ineffectively, eventually believing they have married the wrong person and divorce is the only solution. Bulletproof Marriage explains why relationships fail and offers practical guidance and advice to safeguard marriage by approaching issues with business-like problem solving skills to produce a win-win outcome. The authors&#x2019; objective is to help couples learn to love intelligently rather than react emotionally so that they can enjoy a mutually beneficial life-long relationship. Besides sections on Understanding Marriage, Emotion vs Reason, Taking Marriage Apart and Putting it Back Together and Bulletproofing It, the book offers a toolkit of 27 tools to which couples can refer when marriage emergencies arise. Each chapter is followed by an exercise which couples are encouraged to do together. These develop valuable skills and provide a safe framework for exploring problems and finding workable solutions. The co-authors stress the importance of communication with Renato Cardoso writing about some guidelines of successful communication in his blog: Make an effort to listen and understand each other. You&#x2019;ll never be able to communicate intelligently without first understanding what the other person wants to say. This is harder than it looks. Not everyone expresses themselves clearly, and sometimes our negative feelings give a different connotation to our words. Stop. Listen. Do not interrupt the person speaking to you. Ask questions, get more information. Try understanding the other person&#x2019;s point of view, even if you don&#x2019;t agree with them. Tell them what you understood to make sure you got it right. Only then will you be able to speak sensibly and also have the right to be heard. In a follow up blog, he writes: Pay close attention to the signs you send without saying a word. During a conversation, it&#x2019;s very common for either partner to fold their arms and say, &#x201c;Go on, tell me what&#x2019;s bothering you,&#x201d; but they&#x2019;re actually saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather be anywhere else than having this conversation;&#x201d; all this can be said without a word. An open and welcoming body language is key to good communication. Don&#x2019;t expect good results from a conversation if you keep a closed and defensive posture, a sarcastic tone, or audible sighs. Bear in mind that your partner is not your enemy. Your objective is to end the conversation on a good note. Being open to talking is a prerequisite for having a good interaction. Try communicating with your partner in a respectful, clear and friendly way. Your body talks, and it never lies. So beware of your body language. Giving a personal example, Renato writes: Every time I gave Cristiane the silent treatment, it was because I didn&#x2019;t know how to deal with my anger over something she&#x2019;d done. Something that would&#x2019;ve really helped me in those moments was Cristiane asking, &#x201c;What did I do that upset you?&#x201d; It wouldn&#x2019;t change how I dealt with anger (something I only resolved years later), but it would&#x2019;ve helped me by making me feel heard. Anyone who gives the silent treatment, as surprising as it may sound, wants to be heard. But you have to listen, and not start another fight. Find out which buttons you&#x2019;ve been pushing with your partner so you can avoid them next time. Please note that you should ask the question exactly as it is written above, and with a tone of voice that shows you&#x2019;re genuinely interested in listening. People who give their partners the silent treatment are unable to manage their emotions and have not yet learned to deal with anger and other negative emotions. The tip I&#x2019;ve just given you won&#x2019;t resolve their problem, but it&#x2019;ll help those who live with them to minimise it.
