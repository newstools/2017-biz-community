Each day, more than 175 million people share a Love reaction and on average over 800 million people like something on Facebook. More than 1 billion people use Groups every month. &#x201c;To show our appreciation for the many ways people support one another on Facebook, we will share several personalised experiences over the coming days,&#x201d; comments Naomi Gleit, VP of Social Good. &#x201c;We are launching a personalised video to celebrate bringing the world closer together.&#x201d; After someone reacts to a friend's post with love, wishes someone happy birthday, or creates a group, they will see a message in their News Feed thanking them. &#x201c;On Good Adds Up, we are featuring fun facts about how people are contributing to the community. In the US, we are also sharing stories of people who inspire us. Every day, people connect with one another, contribute to their local communities, and help make the world a better place. &#x201c;We want to help do our part as well. As Mark mentioned last week at the Facebook Communities Summit, our mission is to bring the world closer together. Reaching this milestone is just one small step towards that goal. We are excited to continue to build products that allow people to connect with one another, regardless of where they live, or what language they speak.&#x201d;
