Trautmann says what is very important for a truck operator is the fact that comparative tests have shown that Hino 300-Series truck fitted with a six-speed fully automatic transmission is, on average, significantly more economical than a similar truck fitted with AMT. "We conducted an in-house test over three different routes and then had the results verified by an independent party using proper test equipment. Fuel costs can equate to between 40-60% of truck operating costs, depending on the type of operation, so we are delighted with the results of this fuel economy comparison. "Hino is the only Japanese truck manufacturer offering a fully automatic transmission in the medium category and will extend this option to its 500-Series heavy trucks when a new model is introduced to South Africa in the last quarter of this year. The new range will also provide us with a 6x4 model which we have not had before," added Trautmann.
