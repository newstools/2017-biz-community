Disruption has become a fact for CEOs and their businesses, as they respond to heightened uncertainty. Importantly, most see disruption as an opportunity to transform their business model, develop new products and services and reshape their business, so it is more successful than ever before,&#x201d; says Makgotso Letsitsi, partner and executive director for KPMG in South Africa. Highlights of report KPMG&#x2019;s 2017 CEO Outlook report provides insights, based on in-depth interviews with 50 CEOs of some of South Africa&#x2019;s largest companies.
