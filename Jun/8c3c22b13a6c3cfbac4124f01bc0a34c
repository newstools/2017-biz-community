 Luca Bertolli via 123RFSL2C is said to improve the impact and value of campaigns by engaging the right consumers with the right offers to increase response rates and avoid subsidisation. The solution combines data-driven targeting and massive scale. It has the capacity to engage category buyers through digital channels at more than 2,700 stores, and growing, across the US. Marketers can choose to target just their own brand buyers, with tiered offerings and purchase requirements based on historic buying behaviour, or all shoppers in a category, including those who have never bought the brand. By structuring offers that incentivise shoppers to purchase more of a brand than they ordinarily would, it reduces subsidisation. SL2C can be used as a standalone programme or to augment other in-store Catalina campaigns or shopper marketing programmes. SL2C joins the company&#x2019;s other two digital offerings &#x2013; an untargeted load-to-card solution (UL2C) in over 23,000 stores and a precision-targeted offering (TL2C) that is used in combination with the company&#x2019;s in-store media network.
