Wine Cellar Young Guns 2017, from L to R: Paul Hoogwerf, Jessica Saurwein, Callan Williams, Stephanie Wiid, Lukas van Loggerenberg, Franco Lourens, Douglas Mylrea, Danie Carinus and Etienne TerblancheThese nine dynamic winemakers mostly have full-time day jobs and are also producing unique and interesting wines under their own labels. They are the future legends who aren&#x2019;t afraid to shake things up and set the tone with minimal intervention and natural winemaking. With a host of new labels, niche grape varieties, different styles and interesting personalities, these Young Guns are set to push the boundaries. The pick of the crop: Callan Williams, Garajeest The Garajeest in winemaker Williams&#x2019;s words is &#x201c;an expression of fascination with life, vines, and verse&#x201d;. Having learned the ropes at Iona, Zimbabwean-born Williams found a home at Cape Crush making straight varietal Semillon and Cabernet Franc wines. Williams&#x2019;s &#x2018;The Garajeest Jim S millon 2015&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Garajeest Bruce Cabernet Franc 2015&#x2019;, produced in high volumes, are inspired by the concept of lyrics and legends, each wine named after a different musician. Danie Carinus, Carinus Family Vineyards Carinus talks passionately about his love for Chenin and tells a tale of humble beginnings, renting cellar space from his cousin at Overgaauw and refers to himself as the &#x2018;boy in the bubble&#x2019; among amazing winemakers. As the first viticulturist Young Gun, Carinus is driving efforts to raise the profile of wine farming in South Africa. His wines, the &#x2018;Carinus Family Vineyards Chenin Blanc 2016&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Carinus Family Vineyards Syrah 2016&#x2019;, however, tell a different story, one of talented promise and a great winemaking future. Franco Lourens, Lourens Family Vineyards &#x201c;I truly believe that if you get it right in the vineyards, the quality will follow through in the cellar,&#x201d; says Lourens of his wines, the &#x2018;Lourens Family Wines Lindi Carien 2016&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Lourens Family Wines Howard John 2016&#x2019;. No yeast, acid, enzymes or fining agents are used in the three vintages under his own label and only old oak barrels and clay pots are employed for maturation of varietals such as Grenache and Syrah. Currently the assistant winemaker at Alheit Vineyards with work experience at both Edgebaston and Schalk Burger & Sons, Lourens gathered experience during local harvests at Tokara and Jordan and international harvests in both Australia and California. Jessica Saurwein, Saurwein &#x201c;The philosophy behind Nom Pinot Noir is to mirror the beauty, elegance, and depth of the unique terroir of the Kaimansgat vineyard in the Elandskloof valley,&#x201d; says Saurwein. Equipped with a degree in oenology and viticulture from Stellenbosch University as well as various local and international harvests, Saurwein cut her teeth at Bouchard Finlayson and Klein Constantia. Now full-time sales and marketing manager at Kleinood Farm in Stellenbosch, she has recently released her second vintage Saurwein Nom Pinot Noir 2016, rated 90 points by international wine critic Neal Martin. Lukas van Loggerenberg, Van Loggerenberg Wines &#x201c;Cabernet franc is like a beautiful woman who knows what she wants,&#x201d; says Van Loggerenberg about his favourite varietal. Calling his &#x2018;Van Loggerenberg Breton Cabernet Franc 2016&#x2019; a sexy lady is no understatement, the wine is elegant and herbaceous and according to Van Loggerenberg, best served with "lamsbout", a slow roasted leg of lamb. Add to this the &#x2018;Van Loggerenberg Geronimo Cinsault 2016&#x2019;, inspired by a call of &#x2018;Geronimoooo&#x2019; during a cliff jump to overcome his fear of heights, and we&#x2019;re looking at a daring portfolio of dry, low alcohol wines with immense aging potential that are sure to catapult Van Loggerenberg to winemaking fame. Etienne Terblanche and Stephanie Wiid, Thistle & Weed &#x201c;Farmers often curse thistles and weeds; they&#x2019;re spiny, prickly and a nuisance at the very least. But, it is their tenacity and uncompromising survival skills in which we can draw parallels with the grapevine &#x2013; considered by many as the ultimate weed,&#x201d; says Terblanche. With more than 25 harvests between them, Wiid and Terblanche have travelled the world, seen vineyards growing in the valleys of the Loire and terraced slopes of the Douro, shovelled the fermented skins of West Sussex and Bordeaux, tasted the grapes in misty New Zealand and sampled amazing wines from around the world. &#x2018;The Thistle & Weed Duwweltjie (Devils Thorn) Chenin Blanc 2016&#x2019; and &#x2018;Thistle & Weed Nastergal (Black Nightshade) Tempranillo & Alicante Bouschet 2016&#x2019; is inspired by local vineyard weeds. Etienne and Stephanie aim to produce small batches with minimal intervention in fresh artisanal style wines. Paul Hoogwerf and Douglas Mylrea, Maanschijn Nestled in the shadows of Maanschynkop, between Hermanus and Stanford, lies a cellar which could be mistaken for an illicit moonshining operation and the home of Maanschijn wines. With a passion fuelled by multiple vintage experiences and a consistent philosophy of minimal intervention, Mylrea and Hoogwerf seek to continuously bring innovative wines and styles to the table. Their wines, the &#x2018;Maanschijn Easy Tiger Grenache Gris 2016&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Maanschijn Verdelho 2017&#x2019; mirror their lust for life and clearly establish them as &#x201c;partners in wine&#x201d; to be reckoned with.
