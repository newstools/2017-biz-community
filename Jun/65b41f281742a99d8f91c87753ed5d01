Now, we don&#x2019;t like to name drop or anything, but having hosted speakers from Google, KFC, AXE and Brandseye means that people couldn&#x2019;t wait to attend every single Digital Swarm. But, as each event approached we simply couldn&#x2019;t cater for the number of guests that were wanting to attend. The only thing that was left to do was to get bigger... and better! We are excited to announce the launch of Digital Swarm - Joburg addition! With our sponsors: Vega School of Branding, City Lodge Hotel Group and Growthpoint, we see big things happening! We plan on focusing our energy on making this an event that becomes a crucial part of the advertising industry. If you want to network, or pick the brains of some of the finest the industry has to offer, then this is one event you definitely shouldn&#x2019;t be missing out on. Ranging from local hotshots to up-and-coming talent, you&#x2019;ll find someone interesting and insightful around every corner. We&#x2019;ve got some incredible speakers lined up for our next Durban Digital Swarm &#x2013; don&#x2019;t forget to sign up so that you can be first in line to get your tickets (they go quickly). If money is a little tight, then worry not &#x2013; the tickets are free!
