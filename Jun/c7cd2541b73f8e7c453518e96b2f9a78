The gin maker has partnered with 3 bars across Cape Town, including Burger & Lobster, Harvey&#x2019;s at The Mansions, and The Twankey Bar to facilitate the unorthodox transaction. The bars will accept bona fide cucumbers of any species as currency &#x2013; or &#x201c;bar tender&#x201d; &#x2013; in exchange for a refreshing Hendrick&#x2019;s & Tonic during the world&#x2019;s first dedicated &#x2018;Cucumber Hour&#x2019; &#x2013; a perfect twist on the popular &#x2018;cocktail hour&#x2019; offering. &#x2018;Cucumber Hour&#x2019; will run from 17:00 to 18:00 from Monday, 5 June to Wednesday, 14 June, and is limited to the first 30 cucumbers presented at each bar on each day. This delightful offering follows a somewhat unusual, but genuinely scientific experiment by Hendrick&#x2019;s Gin with cucumber scientist Graham Brown of the University of Sydney to quantify the true sensitivity of cucumbers &#x2013; and the results revealed were astonishing. The green subjects grew larger and juicier as a result of unconventional caring methods, revealing they love rock music, loathe jazz, have a liking for the smell of dill and taste sweeter if swaddled in mini sleeping bags. The last three months have seen green-fingered fans across the globe initiate a bond with their own cucumbers in similarly peculiar ways to cultivate them in readiness for World Cucumber Day - an annual celebration of the inimitable green fruit and its remarkable virtues. Enigmatic qualities of the unassuming cucumber Duncan McRae, Hendrick&#x2019;s Global Ambassador comments, &#x201c;For many years now Hendrick&#x2019;s has sought to elevate the many enigmatic qualities of the unassuming cucumber, due to the role it plays in our most unusual gin alongside the Bulgarian rose. &#x201c;Mr Brown&#x2019;s research illustrates that plants are intelligent and responsive. It means humans can have a deep and meaningful relationship with our most prominent infusion and preferred garnish &#x2013; the cucumber. At Hendrick&#x2019;s we have been dreaming of late of a wondrous world where individuals can swap the green of cash for the green of a cucumber. The sensitive green fruit should be held in high esteem as a precious commodity and in observance of World Cucumber Day, we wholeheartedly encourage trading a mighty cucumber in exchange for the most palatable of libations, a Hendrick&#x2019;s & Tonic.&#x201d; For more information on World Cucumber Day and the rare cucumber revelations visit the World Cucumber Day Experiment website.
