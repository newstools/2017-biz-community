Tell us about your startup business. How did you come about the idea? KapitalWise is a machine-learning empowered micro-investing solution for financial institutions to discover, engage and convert retail users into investors. Using simple rules such as roundup investing, we automate a seamless and effortless experience of investing for our clients. Both Sajil [Sajil Koroth - CEO] and I are immigrants. When we came to the US with limited knowledge of financial institutions and the capital market, we had no idea where to start. Many of our friends share the same frustration, so we built a solution for our friends like us. How did you hear about, and what motivated you to apply for the Barclays Accelerator programme? Sajil was in a TechStar London programme last year so we were in the TechStar network. The South African market and the strong backing of financial institutions including the POCs (proof of concepts) with ABSA motivated us to apply. What is the long-term vision for your company? As Swipe is to the payment industry, KapitalWise wants to become an auto investing platform for banks and other business partners on micro investing. What do you hope to gain/learn from this programme? We hope to complete Barclays/ABSA POCs, test our product and solutions with Barclays/ABSA, establish a more strategic channel partnership and make lots of contacts with mentors and peers at this cohort. What are you most looking forward to in the upcoming 13 weeks of the programme? To completing the Barclays/ABSA POC, establish a strong partnership with non-financial platforms, and complete our seed round funding.
