As an association that advocates for and supports the rights of its members, all of whom are media freelancers, Safrea appeals to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee for Trade and Industry to consider the unsatisfactory aspects of this bill.

Senior members, Geof Kirby and Gareth Griffiths engaged with the bill on behalf of Safrea when issues pertaining to members&#x2019; rights and best interests were initially raised in 2015.
