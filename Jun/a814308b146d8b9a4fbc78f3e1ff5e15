Under her leadership Huisgenoot has grown to the biggest Afrikaans publishing site in South Africa.

She held roles as news editor and assistant editor at Huisgenoot, senior editor at Sarie and deputy editor at Die Burger before being appointed as Huisgenoot editor in 2012. Loubser says she is extremely excited about this new challenge. &#x201c;Driving a successful paywall strategy for our biggest Afrikaans news asset has become a calling,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;I am honoured to be tasked with building Netwerk24 as the home for quality journalism in Afrikaans.
