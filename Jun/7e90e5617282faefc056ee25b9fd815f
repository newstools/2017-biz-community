Starting in Johannesburg on 12 July, and in Durban on 19 July, these one-day accredited workshops focus on online reputation management and data analysis. Through hands-on discussions and application sessions, the Digital Brand Analysis workshop investigates the value of various reputation management tools for brands and teaches candidates how to measure their brand&#x2019;s digital influence. This workshop will enable candidates to develop a social media crisis plan and help candidates develop an understanding of their brand&#x2019;s digital footprint. Furthermore, candidates will gain an understanding of the importance of Google Analytics and Social Insights metrics, and how they correspond to relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPI&#x2019;s). Upon completion of the Digital Brand Analysis SETA accredited workshop, candidates will receive a nationally recognised certificate. If you&#x2019;re looking to upskill or update your knowledge on online brand reputation management and you&#x2019;d like to learn how to turn your brand&#x2019;s consumer data into actionable insights, sign up for this SETA accredited workshop, here: http://bit.do/digital-brand-analysis
