From the 21-23 July at the Sandton Convention Centre in Joburg Rush will feature a variety of competitive tournaments by leading local organisations hosted on dedicated esports stages, with live shoutcasting (commentary) by some of South Africa's top shoutcasters. South Africa's top gamers and clans will compete for the honour of taking the top spots, as well as for a host of incredible prizes. Perhaps the biggest draw for esports is the spectator value &#x2013; fans and supporters will be able to watch the competitions live on big screens with dedicated seating areas at all the stages. Three main stages have already been confirmed, showcasing popular titles such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), FIFA 17 and League of Legends. In addition, there&#x2019;ll be a Street Fighter V tournament where casual as well as professional gamers can take part. Games such as these, with their dedicated fan bases, will showcase the best local talent that esports has to offer. &#x201c;Rush aims to provide a neutral and inclusive platform for all the local esports organisations to host their respective events under one roof,&#x201d; said Lauren Das Neves, marketing manager for Rush, Nag and rAge. &#x201c;We want to foster an environment that will not only benefit local tournament hosts, but encourage new esports talent, as well as provide a centre of activity where local esports fans can gather to interact with and support their favourite teams and players. Rush is not another rAge, it&#x2019;s something completely different.&#x201d; Partnerships with HP Omen and Orena Rush is also thrilled to announce its headline partnership with HP Omen. &#x201c;We are proud to be partnering with Rush as the headline sponsor for this inaugural esports event. We said we would re-enter the high-end gaming PC market and we are back with an impressive line-up of Omen PCs,&#x201d; said David Rozzio, managing director of HP Inc South Africa. &#x201c;This partnership shows our interest to help gamers dominate games.
