In 2017, the SERAS has opened the competition further with East African businesses now also eligible to enter. The team at the SERAS recognises that East Africa is one of the fastest growing, and most stable regions in Africa and has a well developed corporate and NGO sector, and all organisations from the region are encouraged to enter the awards within the various categories. Yielding real-world results The theme for the 2017 awards is Transformational Sustainability: From Social Responsibility to Social Impact, a theme that challenges corporates to ensure their social responsibility investments yield real-world results. This edition of the the SERAS seeks to uncover the brands that have walked their talks in the real sense, and to highlight and reward those investments and interventions that lead to actual impacts in communities where organisations do business and in general society at large. There are 25 awards categories that businesses can enter including; Best Company in Poverty Reduction, Best Company in Eradication of Hunger, Best Company in Promotion of Gender Equality, Best Company in Provision of Clean Water & Sanitation, Best Company in Affordable & Clean Energy, Best Company in Industry & Innovation, Most Sustainable Cities/Communities Award, as well as the regional award for Best Company in CSR/Sustainability East Africa. The competition is open to large-, medium- and small-scale, not-for-profit organisations, as well as public sector organisations.
