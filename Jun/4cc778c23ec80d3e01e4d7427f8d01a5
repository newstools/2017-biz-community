Local community members noticed the suspicious behaviour and appearance of the two men and alerted Ezemvelo's anti-poaching units. The provincial wildlife agency's spokesman, Musa Mntambo, said the men were arrested about 2km from the park's boundary fence. "Their clothes were soaked in blood. They admitted poaching a rhino and voluntarily led the antipoaching unit to where they had hidden the horn." Mntambo said investigators and sniffer dogs were searching for the weapon and horn-cutting tools. Despite the arrests of suspected poachers, the rhino death toll in KwaZulu-Natal is 119 for this year alone - an average killing rate of one rhino every 33 hours. Last year 162 rhinos were killed and 116 in 2015 - when the killing rate was one animal every 75 hours. In 2008, only 18 were poached. Earlier this week, anti-poaching units arrested a poacher in the Makhamisa section of the park. Shortly after 1am on Monday, 12 June, gunshots were heard and when armed rangers investigated they came under fire from a group of poachers. The rangers immediately returned fire, wounding one of the poachers. He was arrested, but his two accomplices fled into the night, leaving behind a .375 rifle, a silencer and 14 rounds of ammunition. Ezemvelo CEO David Mabunda said 80 suspected rhino poachers had been arrested this year. Source: The Times
