Millennials are becoming the biggest spending generation year-on-year, yet brands are missing out because of ineffective marketing strategies. The rise of millennials has forced brands to stop relying on the idea that they can expect to gain loyalty from its customers. Brands have to find new ways of marketing &#x2013; to engage and earn customer loyalty. The complexity of the millennials market makes it very hard to penetrate. Like every generation that came before, they come with their own set of characteristics that make them unique. They have different attitudes, requirements and buying behaviour. The best way to prepare for future marketing trends is to study the behaviour of this demographic. We have invited subject matter experts to the Marketing to Millennials Seminar to be held 27 July 2017 to share best practices on how to engage this market.
