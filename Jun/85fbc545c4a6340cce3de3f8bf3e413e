The previous record of 144.126 kilometres held by Harald Muller (also set in a Toyota 86) has been bettered by 20.914 kilometres. The Toyota 86 completed 1000 Laps over five hours, forty-six minutes to 'slide' Adams into the record books (to be verified by Guinness). The #86DriftRecord Toyota 86 tallied up 165.04 kilometres to potentially cement the number into the Guinness World Record book.
