Tumi Morake is South Africa&#x2019;s top comedienne, TV star, award-winning actress, performer, writer and mother of three. Both Bester and Morake bring a mix of personality to the radio waves &#x2013; Bester, who is proudly South African, generous and giving; Morake who is brave, funny and wickedly witty. Together they are set to serve up a fun and scintillating breakfast that is familiar, but edgy, proudly South African, caring and real. Both presenters say they're ready and raring to get going with the show. Bester says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a really exciting challenge &#x2013; brand new, cutting-edge stuff. We&#x2019;ve got a great team and I&#x2019;m a fan of each player, especially Tumi. I love her energy and sense of humour and the fact that she calls it as it is. Also, it&#x2019;s a huge honour to have breakfast with the most influential, hardworking audience in the country and we can&#x2019;t wait to get on air!&#x201d; While Morake says that this is a career-defining moment for her. &#x201c;Becoming a part of a brand-new breakfast show and cutting my teeth in radio is both daunting and exciting. This is a golden opportunity for me to work with one of the best radio presenters in South Africa and to also be his groupie when he sings! I have already learnt so much from Martin and the team is so dynamic!" The station's GM Kevin Fine, says: &#x201c;Martin and Tumi are at the top of their respective games and make the perfect combination for a brand-new, never-been-done-before show &#x2013; the audience will quickly fall in love with them.&#x201d; Programme manager, Gavin Meiring believes that this team is going to define breakfast radio in South Africa: &#x201c;Martin Bester has a great understanding of breakfast radio, and teaming him up with a talent of Tumi Morake&#x2019;s caliber will be sensational.&#x201d; In celebration of the new show, more than a quarter of a million rand will be up for grabs in the first week of airing, so listen up!
