This is the airline&#x2019;s first World Airline Award and is based on votes from customers making use of an airline&#x2019;s services. &#x201c;The award is a welcome accolade and suggests that Fastjet is on the right trajectory,&#x201d; says head of the airline, Nico Bezuidenhout. &#x201c;This recognition comes as the stabilisation plan concludes and our focus broadens beyond commercial stability to positive movement in terms of network, distribution and fleet.&#x201d; He adds that Fastjet&#x2019;s plans to assume the role of Africa&#x2019;s first pan-continental low-cost airline are well underway. Says Bezuidenhout: &#x201c;Above all else, I would like to acknowledge our people, the Fastjet team, whose efforts have embraced our culture and mantra and have expressed it through creating a positive customer experience. The award belongs to everyone at Fastjet whose hard work has made it possible.&#x201d;
