&#x201c;Today is an important milestone for Emirates as we launch full operations into the market and reinforce our commitment to growing trade and tourism flows between Dubai and Croatia. Since establishing our commercial presence in the market in 2003, we have worked with our trade and tourism partners to make this day happen,&#x201d; said Thierry Antinori, Emirates&#x2019; executive vice president and chief commercial officer. "We believe that this direct daily flight between Dubai and Zagreb will bring many benefits to our country. Namely, it will enable significant increase of trade relations between countries and will have the especially positive impact on tourism. With Emirates' daily flights, Croatia will not only become the centre of Southeast Europe in connection with the Middle East - the most propitious part of the world in terms of industrial growth, but will also be connected with many other countries like China, India, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan&#x201c;, stated minister of tourism of the Republic of Croatia Gari Cappelli.
