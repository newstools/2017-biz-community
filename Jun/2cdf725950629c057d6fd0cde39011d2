 Elisabeth Coelfen via 123RFGeorge Tomazos from AGT Foods Retail and Food Ingredients in South Africa &#x2013; which produces flours from pulses, grains and seeds for supply to large retailers and the hospitality industry &#x2013; has noticed the trend. "We have seen a marked increase in the global pulse flour market due to its low fat, high fibre, and low glycaemic index. The gluten-free nature of pulse flour and its ability to enhance the texture and shelf-life of food is likely to boost the market&#x2019;s growth even further,&#x201d; he said. Bakery and snacks account for a major share of the global pulse flour market. Pulse flour substitutes other flours in bread without altering the taste much, which is expected to drive the demand for this commodity in the future.
