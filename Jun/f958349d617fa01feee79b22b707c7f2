The control room is the brand-new 4K resolution production system that can record all formats and can be adapted to suit any production. The NDI (Network Device Interface) Tricaster is the only one in the country and can accommodate 44 SDI (Serial Digital Interface) inputs and can iSo (isolated recording) record all inputs as well as a master. With multilayer and two clip players, and four downstream keyers, any studio production becomes a breeze. The Tricaster has advanced virtual set capability with full perspective zoom, tilt and pan. Chyron Graphics and Live Expert take care of all your graphics, titling and social media requirements. The 3Play for slow motion, highlight packages and two channels of playback makes logging any material in the system easy. Two gaming computers as well as four channels of high definition Skype completes the system. Audio is managed by a 32-channel audio desk, eight lapels, eight handheld mics, eight earpieces, four countrymen, seven commentator headsets and two commentary boxes. A full multitasking system is installed for quality and backup. The studio is 12m x 14m with a lighting grid and all lighting needed to flat light a basic or virtual green screen set. The studio can accommodate up to eight cameras of four full 4K resolution cameras. And the cherry on top of all this? There is a green room for clients with full kitchen, bathroom and a make-up room for artists. There is also a small boardroom and office for clients to use with the large boardroom available to be booked for pre-production meetings. Although we have plenty of space to work hard, we also have space where clients can put their feet up. There is a viewing room, bar with pool table and foosball that can be used for clients to relax.
