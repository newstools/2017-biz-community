&#x201c;We are proud to serve great-tasting food to the millions of guests that come to our restaurants every month. We are customer-obsessed through maintaining our brand DNA of Quality, Service, Cleanliness and Value,&#x201d; added Solomon. The media engagement event was designed to educate everyone in attendance about the restaurant&#x2019;s high-quality food standards that are coupled with strictly enforced cooking procedures. The evening included an interactive cook-off competition testing the skills of the media in putting together the iconic Big Mac . Lots of fun was had as everyone tried to listen to the clues and remember the ingredients from last time they had a Big Mac at one of the 250 McDonald&#x2019;s restaurants across the country. It was amazing to see how many of the guests knew the Big Mac and could recreate it almost identical to the one selling in store. The fun cook-off was judged by none other than the world-renowned chef, Honorary President of the South African Chefs Association (SACA), Chef Martin Kobald, who also prepared the meal for the evening &#x2013; using ingredients found in most of McDonald&#x2019;s meals.
