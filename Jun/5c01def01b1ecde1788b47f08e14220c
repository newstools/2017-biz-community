Catch him this Friday, 9 June 2017 in Pretoria at the Blou Hond at 8.30pm. The shows then moves to Cape Town, Pringle Bay, Mossel Bay, Prince Albert and many more stops (tour runs for a month). I caught up with him last week and chatted to him while we looked out over his garden. When are you happiest? These three things always make me happy: Being in nature. The company of loved ones. The pursuit of knowledge. What does music mean to you? It is the grand unifying theory of spirit, mind and body. It establishes a secure connection between these cardinal aspects of humanness and reciprocally confirms and supports each of them. Any funny moments on stage? Many! The most recent was adapting to the unearthly-odd-going-out-of-tune-in-the-middle-of-a-song-string, which led to a botched jazz rendition of said song. Your heroes? No mortal is worthy of the accolade. Which living person do you admire most and why? Admiration is a cruel mistress that will abandon you the moment you tie the knot with her. Humans, like myself, are fallible. Though, while I refrain from admiring people, I do often admire their deeds or accomplishments. What is your most treasured possession? My home. The song you wished you wrote? Happy birthday to you. Dream gig to do? O2 Arena . What makes you stand out? The chair I&#x2019;m standing on. Any nicknames? My male friends each have a hugely insulting name for me, all of them unfit for publication. I reciprocate in kind; that&#x2019;s how we express our adoration for one another. If you were not a musician what would you do? Gardener or cowboy. Pick five words to describe yourself? 1 &#x2013; I 2 &#x2013; don&#x2019;t 3 &#x2013; trust 4 &#x2013; self 5 &#x2013; descriptions. Five desert island discs? Animals &#x2013; Pink Floyd Voulez Vous &#x2013; Abba Remasters &#x2013; Led Zeppelin Tusk &#x2013; Fleetwood Mac Selling England by the pound &#x2013; Genesis What song changed your life? Sledgehammer by Peter Gabriel. Who do you love? It is a daily pursuit of mine to remind myself to love everybody. I don&#x2019;t always succeed. What is your favourite word? Onomatopoeia. Favourite fashion garment? My grey paisley Hans ubbink blazer. Top of your bucket list? To walk the entire length of Chile with a backpack. Your greatest achievement? The two seconds during this morning&#x2019;s meditation when I actually managed to love everybody. What do you complain about most often? The neglect of education. What is your fear? That I will fart aloud in church. Happiness is? A good idea. If you are walking on stage for a keynote speech, what song would you use and why? Do I have to say the words by Bryan Adams. The best life lesson you have been taught? Don&#x2019;t box a boxer. Where would you like to be right now? From my vantage point at home, looking out over my garden, I am very much exactly where I would like to be. Social media links Chris Chameleon website Chris Chameleon Facebook page.
