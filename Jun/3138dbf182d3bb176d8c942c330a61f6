Select will continue to operate at 81 Juta Street until 30 June 2017 and Puma Select in Cape Town will continue as a standalone on Bree Street. Maintaining the all-over wooden industrial look from its current location, Select will be easily distinguishable within the Puma store. This is in keeping with other Select areas within Puma stores internationally. The design of the Select space will include access to an internal courtyard, which will host events, such as the ongoing Select X Stories series. &#x201c;We are looking to streamline our Braamfontein retail offering by placing Select within our Puma store, which is one of our flagships in South Africa. Puma fans will now be able to shop our mainline offering as well as our premium streetwear within the convenience of one store,&#x201d; said Puma South Africa&#x2019;s marketing director Brett Bellinger. Over the years, Select has featured collaborations with local and international brands, stores, designers, artists and musicians and will unveil three new collaborations in the upcoming season. &#x201c;We have been honoured to work with Rihanna and The Weeknd, who have emerged from being brand ambassadors to design collaborators with Puma. Similarly, we have worked with Mikey Trapstar, the Daily Paper crew and Jeff Staple. Collaborating with these individuals has resulted in a product offering that is both sincere and personal, which is something that is carried through to our consumer,&#x201d; said Bellinger.
