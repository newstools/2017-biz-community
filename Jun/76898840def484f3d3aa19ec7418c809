The groups had ten days to produce their campaigns, in time to go live with &#x2018;Cannected&#x2019;, a Cannes event for local marketers that cannot attend the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. &#x201c;This event was about empowering creatives to help small and medium businesses bring their stories to life and create magical customer experiences,&#x201d; says Charmagne Mavudzi, marketing and communications manager at Ogilvy & Mather South Africa. &#x201c;In a mobile-first country such as South Africa, digital platforms offer smaller businesses a way to market themselves to their communities in a scalable and personalised way.&#x201d;
