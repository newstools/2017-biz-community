Established by the Art Directors Club in 1996, this is the first year Young Guns is part of The One Club for Creativity. The portfolio-based competition, where judges consider a body of both professional and personal work from an individual as opposed to a single design or ad, closes for entries on 31 July 2017 at 11:59 pm EST. Eligible entrants can submit a combination of professional and personal work in graphic design; advertising art direction and copywriting; architectural, environmental and interior design; industrial and product design; digital (UX/UI, experiential design, interactive, web design, apps, game development): film and animation (motion design, television, video); fashion; typography and lettering; illustration and photography. Entry fee is $100 for The One Club and ADC members, $150 for non-members. This year&#x2019;s winners will be recognised at the Young Guns 15 celebration and party on 17 November 2017 in New York. The online entry system is open now at youngguns.org.
