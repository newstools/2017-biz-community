The benefit of SMS marketing is its high open rate of 98%, with most messages read within in just a few minutes after sending. However, you only have limited space to share your message. This means the reader won&#x2019;t process your message as thoroughly as, for example, a long article or an interview. Therefore, a little creativity is essential to get your message across. Moreover, you need to be aware of the consumer&#x2019;s decision-making process and how you can influence this using just a few words. SMS demands other arguments You want to convince the consumer to take a certain action, for example to visit your web shop to cash your SMS coupon? You&#x2019;ll have to address and influence values to change behaviour. This means you need to target either his noble values (for example preserving nature) or his instrumental values (like saving money). To effectively affect behaviour, you need to address one of these. Unless you want to send concatenated messages, that has to be done in a maximum of 160 digits. But how can you accomplish this? In shorter messages, some simplistic arguments are most effective to influence consumers. For example, using sources with a certain authority or mentioning behaviour of others. Besides trustworthy and likeable sources, &#x2018;fear&#x2019; can also be an effective way to influence the effect of your message. But make sure you don&#x2019;t overdo this, because then your audience will want to ignore your message. It holds true for all these arguments that they are more persuasive if you add an example. Test your creativity It's up to your creativity to jam all of this in one single SMS. Because short messages are typically not processed as thoroughly -as mentioned earlier-, it is not only important to use the right arguments to influence values. You will also have to write a brief and attractive message. Some basics to help you do so: Don&#x2019;t use unnecessary words or passive language: you can save costs vs. save costs. Address your reader personally so he is more motivated to read the message. Be concrete in your language, so avoid words like &#x2018;try&#x2019;, &#x2018;soon&#x2019; and &#x2018;good&#x2019;. If you mention arguments, consider that those containing the word &#x2018;because&#x2019; are typically found more convincing. Use a URL- shortener so you don&#x2019;t waste unnecessary characters for your message.</li></li></li></li>Examples All that theory is nice, but of course we also want to give some concrete examples of such short persuasive messages that target either one of the consumer&#x2019;s values. &#x201c;Change the world, start with yourself.
