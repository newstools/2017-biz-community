The ad starts off with an ironic voice-over with the overtone of a sad tune being played on a piano in the background taking listeners on a nostalgic journey back to 2007, highlighting the ten-year duration of Duracell Quantum batteries in storage. It takes a charming and amusing look at past and current trends, events, politicians, celebrities and technology and emphasises how much things can change in ten years. But the one constant is a Duracell Quantum battery. Duracell is the world&#x2019;s leading manufacturer of high performance alkaline batteries, specialty cells and rechargeable batteries. Since its foundation in the early 1940s, the company has become an iconic personal power brand, trusted for compact and longer-lasting batteries. &#x201c;We needed to show longevity of the brand as well as the product. What better way than to tie our concept into the ever-changing times we live in,&#x201d; says Chief Creative Officer at Grey South Africa, Fran Luckin.
