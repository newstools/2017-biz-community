Bastille&#x2019;s first performance will be held in Cape Town on Wednesday, 4 October at GrandWest Casino and Entertainment World. Next up is Durban on Friday, 6 October, at the Durban Botanic Gardens, with the closing act rounding off the tour in Johannesburg the very next day. Tickets are now available for purchase from Webtickets at a cost of R495. Bastille shot to fame in 2013 with their massive hit single Pompeii. The crowd-pleasing hit has since amassed over 400m views on YouTube. One year later, their breakout success was rewarded when they received the Brit Award for the British Breakthrough Act. Their most recent achievement was the NME Award for Best Album &#x2013; &#x2018;Wild World&#x2019; &#x2013; which is their latest to date. Additional host city In 2014, the award-winning band performed in front of sell-out crowds for their debut tour of South Africa. Three years on, Bastille is expected to dominate the stage again, this time with an additional host city &#x2013; Durban. The inclusion of Durban will make for a special visit for the indie pop sensations, with frontman Dan Smith having a close affiliation with the coastal city. Smith&#x2019;s parents met and found love in Durban shortly before crossing the Atlantic to settle in London, England. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re really excited about heading back to South Africa for these shows,&#x201d; says frontman Dan Smith. &#x201c;We had such an incredible time playing in Cape Town and Johannesburg a few years ago, so we can&#x2019;t wait to head back again with some new music and a date in Durban as well.&#x201d; The DNA of Bastille&#x2019;s music is pulled expertly from the nostalgic synth-pop beats of the 80s to harder notes of rock. Their latest album is a fusion of all these styles to create a mashup that shakes the senses. Fans will be able to enjoy all this in just a few months&#x2019; time.
