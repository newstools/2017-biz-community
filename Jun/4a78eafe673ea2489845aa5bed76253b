The client&#x2019;s &#x2018;Stay Wider of the Rider&#x2019; safe cycling campaign aims to change the mind set of motorists by providing them with a visual picture as to why it is essential for a motorist to pass cyclists with a berth of at least one metre. The campaign is ideally suited to the animated/video capabilities of our network and it is especially satisfying when the client produces clever and engaging creative as they have done. Forecourts are an obvious OOH platform, and now being digital, the dwell time allows for the creative to be fully absorbed and enjoyed. The hope that the wide geographical coverage and the large number of sites will further add to the "Top of Mind&#x201d; and start changing road user&#x2019;s behaviour towards cyclists. We look forward to growing this relationship with this client so that we can really add value to their efforts.
