The Little Shop app is a tool that enables users to customise their mobile photos with the use of filters (a filter is a piece of software that changes the appearance of an image in one way or another). The app is free-to-download directly from the App Store or Google Play and users simply have to scan their minis to access the filters, snap away and share. To get going, download the app. In addition to prizes, Checkers has planned a National Swop Day at all Checkers and Checkers Hyper stores on Saturday 24 July. For more information on the National Swap Day and the Little Shop 2 app, visit www.checkerslittleshop.co.za.
