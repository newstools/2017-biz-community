Originating in the Highlands of Scotland in 1846, by founder John Dewar, every drop condenses whisky wisdom acquired over lifetimes. It was John Dewar&#x2019;s sons, John Alexander and Tommy Dewar, who made the company an international success. The brothers also founded the Aberfeldy Distillery in 1898, the physical and spiritual home of Dewar&#x2019;s, which still produces the single malt whisky that lies at the heart of the blend. &#x201c;More than a century later, Dewar&#x2019;s dedication to craftsmanship and time-honoured traditions remain vital to the creation of our classic character and keynotes of our whiskies,&#x201d; said master distiller, Stephanie Macleod. &#x201c;What makes Dewar&#x2019;s true Scotch is it was the first blended Scotch whisky to be branded and bottled and we are proud to say that it is still crafted in the same way today as it was in 1846. &#x201c;It is the most awarded blended Scotch whisky in the world and the only one chosen to supply the royal household for over 100 years. Dewar&#x2019;s has had a Royal Warrant from every British monarch since Queen Victoria in 1893, which makes it unique. We&#x2019;re looking forward to giving South African Scotch drinkers the same royal treatment.&#x201d; Four products have arrived in South Africa, Dewar&#x2019;s 12-year-old and 15-year-old and a 12-year-old and 18-year old from the Aultmore Distillery. These and other whiskies in the portfolio were among the 15 medals awarded at the 17th San Francisco World Spirits Competition in May 2017.
