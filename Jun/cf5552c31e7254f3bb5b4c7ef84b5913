Image supplied.&#x201c;As a JIC (Joint Industry Council) we must have collaborative meetings with agencies and advertisers in our industry. We need an open forum where we can discuss the ES, LSMs, SEMs and any other queries media planners and clients have in a relaxed open workshop. We want to assist marketers and media planners when it comes to day to day planning,&#x201d; says Peter Langschmidt, consultant to the PRC. &#x201c;The PRC will present insights and is looking for feedback on how it is doing as an industry body, how useful its research is, what&#x2019;s working, what's not and what else it can do to make planners&#x2019; lives easier.&#x201d; Many new opportunities in research The workshop will have short presentations on questions received from the industry and include an overview of the PAMS reading currency survey and its release date. Terry Murphy, MD of Nielsen Watch will discuss Fusion and the project of fusing Nielsen Consumer Panel FMCG purchase data with PRC surveys. The era of hub and donor surveys is here, and this opens up many new opportunities in research. In some countries, up to 19 surveys are fused into a single customer and market view. The workshop will be at the Bryanston Country Club from 3pm, followed by drinks and an informal networking session. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re encouraging all of our industry partners and suppliers to pop in, have a chat, give us feedback and submit any queries they may have on any research,&#x201d; concludes Langschmidt.
