This launch follows last year&#x2019;s successful introduction of the Titan washer and dryer in one. &#x201c;The new models each come with their own set of value-enhancing technologies, such as Turbowash and Smart Diagnosis and NFC, which enables a consumer to download a cycle of their choice from their mobile smartphone to fit the needs of their family,&#x201d; says Sulette Jacobs, home appliances, product marketing manager at LG Electronics. &#x201c;We expect SmartThinQ to extend it into many more of our appliances around the home, to simplify the running of consumers&#x2019; households. That&#x2019;s the benefit of convenience that comes with the connected life LG is striving to provide.&#x201d;
