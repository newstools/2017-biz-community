And, with June 18 looming (Father&#x2019;s Day, if you had to ask), those of us fortunate enough to have, or had, fathers present in our lives and those of us who have kids will identify with the latest campaign for Supa Quick, which reminds us that there are some Dads out there who are heroes. Supa-Heroes, even&#x2026; Those of us who did grow up in good homes will remember those times of innocence when, anything we were in trouble, or were confused, we could always ask Dad. Screenshot from the ad. Supa Quick&#x2019;s campaign combines that piece of insight with research that shows that many young people these days don&#x2019;t know the basic things when it comes to cars. And also that, 94% of Millennials go to the Internet for advice before they ask the old man. So, agency Artifact Advertising agency came up with three videos that offer answers to basic motoring questions: How do I change a tyre?; How do I check my car&#x2019;s oil? and How do I jump start a car? #NewCampaign: What would Dad do?Research reveals that more than 60% of Millennials don't know how to change their tyres or check their oil and that 94% of people ask the internet for advice before they ask their dads, says Sandy Smith, client service director at Artifact Advertising - the agency that was briefed by Supa Quick to...31 May 2017 They&#x2019;re all amusing and informative and position Supa Quick as an expert when it comes to helping out on day-to-day motoring problems. The campaign runs under the banner &#x201c;What would Dad do?&#x201d; and runs until Father&#x2019;s Day (I already reminded you of the date), offering prizes for lucky winners. I like it because it reminds all of us of the importance of a father &#x2013; and how, as Mike and the Mechanics once sang, we wish we had appreciated him &#x201c;in the living years&#x2026;&#x201d; An Orchid to Supa Quick and to Artifact. I do realise that General Motors had to play its cards close to its chest on the decision to pull out of South Africa. But the way the announcement was done, at short notice, to staff &#x2013; and then the ones in Port Elizabeth were told to go home for a few days (to contemplate their jobless futures, presumably) &#x2013; left a bad taste. And I do realise that some of the car giant&#x2019;s advertising had been booked months in advance. But, I still find it slightly sick that GM&#x2019;s ads for its Chevrolet bakkies can continue running on radio and elsewhere as if nothing has happened. There may be those who might take a chance on getting a bargain on run-out stock vehicles, but I wouldn&#x2019;t be one of them. I would like to know my car would have backup for some years into the future and, sadly, I don&#x2019;t believe that will be the case with GM products. The irony is in the Chev slogan, which is only too true: Find New Roads. Yep &#x2013; new road somewhere else. An Onion for you GM. Pack it and take it with you. And, finally, yet another grumpy language Onion. There is an ad running at the moment on radio for accounting firm KPMG, which is all about how they can help you with a tax dispute. It&#x2019;s timeous because, I hear, an increasing number of businesses are involved in fights with the SA Revenue Service, especially over VAT refunds. However, KMPG&#x2019;s ad has a line which focuses on its expertise and that of its associates which, it swears, &#x201c;will turn &#x2018;Win&#x2019; into&#x2018;Victory&#x2019;&#x2026;&#x201d; Huh? What is a win if it is not a victory? This column now appears weekly in the Saturday Citizen. You can mail me on az.oc.nezitic&#64;snadnerb .
