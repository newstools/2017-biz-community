Y ello BoxThe Y&#x2019;ello Box is a solar electricity system that officially launched earlier this year in a world first, which allows families and business owners to harness the power of the sun cheaply and efficiently, in a way we&#x2019;ve never seen before. In homes, clinics, schools and businesses across Nigeria, people are running fans, charging phones, watching TVs and lighting rooms, all using affordable, reliable, clean electricity. The Y&#x2019;ello Box is already powering the lives and businesses of more than one hundred thousand Nigerians. Designed and operated by Lumos Mobile Electricity Service, the Y&#x2019;ello Box provides electricity to customers 24 hours a day, which people pay for using their MTN mobile phone.

It has proved itself to be the most reliable and affordable service on the market, with customers delighted at the switch from traditional fuel. Yuri Tsitrinbaum, CEO of the Lumos Mobile Electricity Service said: &#x201c;People don&#x2019;t have access to the power they need. Fuel is very expensive and other services are unreliable. The Y&#x2019;ello Box saves customers money all while providing better and more reliable electricity. As Nigeria modernises, our demand for power increases. It&#x2019;s time we did more to harness the power of the sun. That is why the Y&#x2019;ello Box is changing so many lives. It is affordable, it is reliable and paying by mobile phone makes it easy. &#x201c;Lumos is growing rapidly across Nigeria, as we invest more money, create business opportunities for Nigerians and employ more and more people. Equally important is the fact that the service is improving the everyday operations of community centres like schools, health clinics and religious institutions,&#x201d; added Tsitrinbaum.
