Radebe in 'edit' mode... At the age of 28, Radebe has already directed in 9 countries for local and international agencies and clients. Little wonder as he spent much of his youth recreating his favourite film scenes with nothing but an 8mm camcorder, his BMX and his younger brother as the actor. Zwelethu Radebe joins Egg FilmsRising commercials director Zwelethu Radebe has nestled in at Egg Films, where he'll be working with producer Dumisani Mvumvu from their Johannesburg office...Issued by Egg Films 21 Feb 2017 Embodying the spirit of SA&#x2019;s passionate youth, he went on to finish top of his class throughout film school, winning numerous awards and the bursaries he needed to fund his studies and winning silver at his first Loeries just months after graduating in 2012, for Ster-Kinekor Thato in the student category: 1. Where do you live, work and play? I think it overlaps for me &#x2013; life, work and play. I don&#x2019;t really like to call what I do &#x2018;work&#x2019;; it&#x2019;s mostly fun. Ask anyone at the office: I think they&#x2019;ve heard me and my producer cracking up way too often! 2. What s your claim to fame? Haha! I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m famous yet. 3. Describe your career so far. The Dakar Rally! 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. I love to get lost, travel and meet new people from foreign countries and just talk about our differences in culture and other tastes. I always learn something new and positive, which I try to apply to my own life. 5. What do you love about your industry? Bringing a few words written on a white page to life. 6. What are a few pain points your industry can improve on? Transformation and diversity in the opportunities given. If you want to have fresh ideas and executions, you can&#x2019;t keep recycling the same materials. You can&#x2019;t expect different results if you keep doing the same thing. 7. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about! 8. What are the tools of your trade? Imagination, hard work, consistency and my Boston cap. 9. Who is getting it right in your industry? There's a lot of talents really doing some great things out there. To name a few: Tristan Holmes, Sunu Gonera, Kim Geldenhuys and Terence Neale. 10. What are you working on right now? I just wrapped a job with M&C Saatchi Abel JHB and am about to see an offline this afternoon. 11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. I don&#x2019;t know where these words come from but I know this phrase is lethal: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll fix it in post.&#x201d; 12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? Eish, it&#x2019;s hard to say. It&#x2019;s really random with me as they come out of nowhere so they unfortunately don&#x2019;t have any timing at all or any specific requirement. They just arrive! 13. What&#x2019;s your secret talent/party trick? Getting out of a never-ending conversation with one person. 14. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? A lot of weird people! 15. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? It&#x2019;s a long road. Know what you want to achieve and never lose sight of it.
