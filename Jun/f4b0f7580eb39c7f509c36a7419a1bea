Based upon the forthcoming Rapide AMR concept, the car will deliver four-door sports car looks and dynamics of the Rapide S powered by an all-electric powertrain replacing the six-litre V12 engine. More information will be revealed about the RapidE&#x2019;s all-electric powertrain in due course. Aston Martin president and CEO, Dr Andy Palmer, says: &#x201c;Having unveiled the RapidE concept back in October 2015 we reach another milestone with the confirmation that we are now putting the first all-electric Aston Martin into production. "RapidE represents a sustainable future in which Aston Martin&#x2019;s values of seductive style and supreme performance don&#x2019;t merely co-exist alongside a new zero-emission powertrain, but are enhanced by it. The internal combustion engine has been at the heart of Aston Martin for more than a century, and will continue to be for years to come. It will showcase our vision, desire and capability to successfully embrace radical change, delivering a new breed of car that stays true to our ethos and delights our customers.&#x201d;
