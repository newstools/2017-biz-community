Executive judge, Suthisak Sucharittanonta, chairman and chief creative officer of BBDO BangkokSuthisak Sucharittanonta, chairman and chief creative officer of BBDO Bangkok, a former winning agency in the show, is an executive judge this year. &#x201c;I accepted the invitation to judge Ad Stars because it is different from other awards shows. It is an international awards show that has no entry fee, is judged by international juries and gives monetary prizes to Grand Prix winners,&#x201d; he says. Anselmo Ramos, chief creative officer of David in Miami, is also attending as an executive judge. &#x201c;Everyone says great things about Ad Stars and South Korea. I look forward to judging an award that I haven&#x2019;t judged before, especially one that doesn&#x2019;t charge for submissions, so more people can participate,&#x201d; he adds. There are 18 awards categories this year: &#x2018;Film&#x2019;, &#x2018;Print&#x2019;, &#x2018;Outdoor&#x2019;, &#x2018;Radio&#x2019;, &#x2018;Interactive&#x2019;, &#x2018;Mobile&#x2019;, &#x2018;Promotion&#x2019;, &#x2018;Direct&#x2019;, &#x2018;PR&#x2019;, &#x2018;Integrated&#x2019;, &#x2018;Media&#x2019;, &#x2018;Innovation&#x2019;, &#x2018;Design&#x2019;, &#x2018;Film Craft&#x2019;, &#x2018;PSA&#x2019;, &#x2018;Diverse Insights&#x2019;, &#x2018;Place and Video Stars&#x2019; (for branded content).
