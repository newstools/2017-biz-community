X-trend, Footgear, weFix and Gold Rush Bingo all opened their doors in March and April, and Browns Jewellers made its debut at the centre on 1 June. In addition to the new retail selection, Vaal Mall also underwent a green makeover through the installation of a state-of-the-art solar plant. The plant spans some 390 parking bays to provide green energy to the mall, while at the same time creating covered parking for Vaal Mall&#x2019;s shoppers. Vaal Mall completed its revamp and expansion in March 2016, extending the mall by 15,000 sqm and boosting trade throughout the centre. The expansion saw the introduction of Mr Price Sport, Legit, Cotton On, Due South, Factorie, Bogart Man, Soda Bloc, Studio 88, Crafters Market, Rage, Sorbet, Typo, and Fishaways as well a new Ster-Kinekor cinema complex. Vaal Mall GM, Shana Maree-Paraskevopoulos says, &#x201c;We are delighted at the positive trading accomplished throughout the mall over the past year, showing continued double digit growth with an average of around 15%, with an achievement of over 18% growth in the last six months.&#x201d; Various retail categories continue to perform well at the mall with anchors such as Pick n Pay and Woolworths showing significant growth, while fashion and shoes remain firm favourites with some retailers reporting between a 35 and 50% increase in April 2017 compared to the same period last year. &#x201c;Our restaurants also show similar growth, along with electronics and phone services, as well as the books, cards and stationery categories, which have all enjoyed double-digit growth over the past year. We are also thrilled that as a relatively new addition to Vaal Mall Ster-Kinekor reported its highest turnover to date this past April,&#x201d; concludes Maree-Paraskevopoulos.
