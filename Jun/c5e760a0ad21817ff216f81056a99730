 tomas1111 123RF.comDladla has been appointed with immediate effect, on the eve of the power utility's AGM on Friday, 23 June. "Dladla has sufficient skills to excel in this role. He has 22 years of experience within the Eskom, 17 years invested in various nonregulated businesses and five years as CEO for Eskom Enterprises and its subsidiaries," acting board chairman Zethembe Khoza said in a statement. Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown also welcomed Dladla's appointment, saying he would bring stability to Eskom and the executive. The power utility said Brown had obligated the board to finalise the appointment of a permanent group CE to ensure long-term stability to the utility. The Eskom board was forced to rescind Molefe's reappointment earlier this month, as directed by Brown. Molefe turned to the Labour Court to fight it. He has left Eskom twice in six months - once voluntarily and once under duress. Brown is expected to remove the remaining board members at Friday's AGM. Last week, board chairman Ben Ngubane resigned with immediate effect, citing personal reasons. Source: BDpro
