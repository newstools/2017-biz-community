According to Toyota SA&#x2019;s Senior Manager of Advertising & Digital Marketing, Aidan Castille, the marketing team was looking for a creative idea that positioned limited edition Yaris Pulse as a cool combination of value-for-money, high specification and masculinity. The agency&#x2019;s response was an integrated campaign that links the Yaris Pulse to a calm and collected male personality who is confident being himself, in any situation. &#x201c;The agency team asked itself &#x2018;what does the new Yaris Pulse and a confident man have in common?&#x2019; The answer was that they both get to the point quicker. The bigger engine gets you places faster while a confident man doesn&#x2019;t hum or haw, he cuts to the chase,&#x201d; explained Creative Director, Tian van den Heever. &#x201c;We envisaged this confident man as being one who, rather than relying on his car to give him confidence, looks for a car that compliments the confidence he already has and gives him permission to set that confidence free. &#x201c;The agency developed a personality for the Yaris Pulse and for the man who&#x2019;d drive it. It&#x2019;s a guy who wears what he&#x2019;s comfortable in, not a tailor-made suit; who&#x2019;ll smile at a pretty girl won&#x2019;t wolf-whistle at her; who plays air guitar in traffic, but he doesn&#x2019;t fist-pump in clubs; and who&#x2019;ll drive in the fast lane, but will let people pass if they&#x2019;re going faster. &#x201c;The campaign features this Yaris personality and places him in various situations where, by getting to the point faster, he saves himself a lot of embarrassment and talking in circles. The campaign is bold, it&#x2019;s exciting but it doesn&#x2019;t take itself too seriously; just like the Yaris Pulse,&#x201d; van den Heever said. The campaign currently lives in social media, 3rd party banner targeting, 20 second webisodes, radio, outdoor, print and press. It will soon be joined by TV.
