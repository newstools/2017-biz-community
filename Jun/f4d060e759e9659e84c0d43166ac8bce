Egg Films&#x2019; Dan Mace directed This Is Your Time, Ogilvy&#x2019;s inspiring new ad for Vodacom NXT LVL. The spot subverts the way we immediately box people, suggesting that instead of seeing a poor girl living in a shack, we should see someone with dreams and hustle and a 20-year plan, a whole universe of knowledge in the palm of her hand. &#x201c;This board stood out for me as it was super rich in performance, which is an area I really want to take my reel into,&#x201d; says Dan. Egg&#x2019;s latest signing only had one shoot day to coax the magnetic lead performance out of Siphosethyu &#x2018;Sam&#x2019; Dyani, picked from her first-ever casting. &#x201c;We did loads of prep to get her into the right space, but when she was on set it just came naturally,&#x201d; says Dan. &#x201c;She was great to work with and took direction really well, which meant we had time to really focus on camera and making sure that was on point.&#x201d; Stephen du Plessis edited the spot, keeping the performance central while allowing Dan&#x2019;s distinctive technical wizardry to add another layer to the spot&#x2019;s message about the power of technology. &#x201c;I am proud of the end product and stoked to be a part of a message so relevant in our country,&#x201d; says Dan. &#x201c;Those are the ads I dig.&#x201d; Fabian Vettiger shot This Is Your Time, which was conceptualised by Ogilvy&#x2019;s creative team of producer Helen d&#x2019;Hotman, creative director Candice Hellens, copywriter Palesa Motiki, and art director Mantwa Toka. Last week, Dan won his third Young Director Award in two years at Cannes Lions - a South African record. Dan won a Silver Screen award in the Broadcast category for the Here&#x2019;s To The US In Every Tusker ad he directed in Kenya with Groundglass for Net#work BBDO. Dan was the only winner from Africa in the category. He was also shortlisted in the Changing The World Frame By Frame category for Tusker Flag 42. Last year, Dan won two Silver Screen Young Director Awards: for Gift in the Short Film category and The Bomb Sniffing Rats Saving Lives in Mozambique in the Changing The World Frame By Frame category.
