Within the existing search functionality, the app now features a camera icon, which allows shoppers to take a live photo or upload an image from the smartphone photo library, and it will return visually similar items in seconds. Finding similar styles while browsing is now also easier. Shoppers can tap and hold any product image in a category or search results view and the feature will highlight visually similar items. Adopting a mobile-app-first approach, Spree has initially launched the image search and similar styles shopping feature on the Spree iOS app, with a roll-out plan to the Android app and the website scheduled for the next couple of months. &#x201c;Our goal is to make the shopping experience for our customers as easy and intuitive as possible and, with our new image recognition capabilities and similar style shopping feature, we think we have come closer to achieving this. Searching for items with photos and images saves consumers from having to type keyword combinations, which is challenging on mobile devices," says Sven Schoof, Spree&#x2019;s head of customer experience. &#x201c;In a world where words are commonly replaced by emojis and images, it makes sense that our shopping habits follow the same path and we&#x2019;re very proud to be the first online retailer in Africa to lead this visual trend.&#x201d; Taking advantage of the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technologies available, Spree&#x2019;s similar style shopping feature bases its suggestions on silhouette, colour, pattern and texture and customers can filter seamlessly by gender. With AI tech being ranked in the top five trends driving change and growth in retail in the next few years, Spree believes its image search feature sets the bar in shaping the fashion landscape in Africa.
