"The decision to hold the 2017 iWeek in Durban reflects the city's growing importance to the South African and African internet," said ISPA chair Graham Beneke. He highlighted the fact that Durban last year became the first South African city to get a multi-site internet exchange point. This important milestone was achieved following a public-private partnership between INX-ZA and Ethekwini Municipality (Durban Municipality). Internet exchange points enable internet service providers to interconnect their networks so that users benefit from faster connections and more efficient access to online services. This year, iWeek will be held in conjunction with the Southern African Network Operators Group (SAFNOG), a grouping of internet industry professionals dedicated to building and sustaining communities of network operators in the Southern African region. Other key partners for this year include INX-ZA, the ZA Domain Name Authority (ZADNA), the ZA Central Registry (ZACR), the Internet Society and WASPA. The Internet Society will be hosting their ION conference on 7 September 2017. ION conferences bring network engineers and leading industry experts together to discuss emerging technologies including IPv6 and DNSSEC. The event will be held from 4-7 September 2017 at the Southern Sun Elangeni and Maharani and attendance is free to delegates who pre-register.
