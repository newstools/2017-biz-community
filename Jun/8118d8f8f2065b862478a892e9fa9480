 Brent Hofacker via 123RF&#x201c;At the start of the season, with a few cool days, we thought the colour would be good. But this year the colour on Pink Lady isn&#x2019;t great,&#x201d; explains Leardt van der Burgh, marketing manager at Kromco. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had to cut back on our retail programmes and there is a bit of a shortage in the European market which could have a positive effect on prices. Pink Lady is a sought-after item in Europe.&#x201d; &#x201c;The effect of the freeze in April and May in Europe caused a fair bit of damage, especially in Italy, Holland, and Poland. Poland, in particular, has a big influence on the Russian and Middle East apple market and I think in the 2018 season this could create opportunities for us.&#x201d; In fact, despite pessimism earlier in the season, this year is already turning out to be a stable apple season for South African exporters, especially regarding Golden Delicious. &#x201c;Last year Goldens were our biggest concern but this year we pack Goldens every week and as soon as they are packed, they move out. This flow is what&#x2019;s bringing about stability,&#x201d; explains Van der Burgh. &#x201c;At the start of the season everyone was skeptical about the African market and Goldens and the effect of our fluctuating currency but the currency has since stabilised somewhat.&#x201d; Growers need to focus on varieties with a prospect of successful cultivation Given the particular climatic conditions of South Africa, and the Western Cape, in particular, growers need to focus on the varieties with a prospect of successful cultivation. Van der Burgh, who sits on the Kanzi Board of South Africa, uses this variety as an example of one whose production practices still need to be fine-tuned for South African conditions. &#x201c;The question remains: can we produce the Kanzi as well as Europe does? Pink Lady we are able to produce very successfully.&#x201d; Kromco will market pears for two more weeks and all its apple varieties until the end of the year, with the exception of Royal Gala, of which volumes will run out in four or five weeks, limited by available volumes and strong demand. &#x2013; Fresh Plaza
