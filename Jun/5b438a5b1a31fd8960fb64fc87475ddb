Using 3D imaging technology, this US-based startup hopes to eliminate the problem by producing beautiful footwear uniquely designed to fit only you. Called True Gault, the company has successfully integrated technology and software within shoemaking. Through a specially designed app available to some iPhone users, users are able to scan their own feet from the comfort of their homes, design their own shoe and send it directly to the company for production. Four weeks later they&#x2019;ll be delivered to the user's doorstep. In an interview with Democrat & Chronicle, True Gault CEO and founder, Sandra Gault, discussed the potential of her unique business venture: "We're going to be doing things online. We're going to be expanding through a direct sales model. There are lots of really cool things that are going to be coming. My vision is, in the near future, people will look back and say, 'Can you believe how we used to buy shoes?'" True Gault guarantees an accurate and true fit; if not they&#x2019;ll make adjustments until it is as close to perfection as possible. The 3D design app allows customers to select and design their shoe by choosing from 75+ quality leathers, a variety of colours, and either booties or heels. That style is then immediately digitally stored in the company&#x2019;s system &#x2013; meaning it will never be discontinued. &#x201c;If nobody buys it,&#x201d; Gault says, &#x201c;it doesn't matter. We build to order. We do everything backwards to the shoe industry." Pricing for the customised footwear starts from $250 and The True Gault app is currently available by invitation only.
