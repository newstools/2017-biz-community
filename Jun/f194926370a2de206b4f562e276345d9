The Board of Wan-Ifra denounced the draft Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, which would criminalise &#x2018;bringing contempt and ridicule&#x2019; onto figures of authority, as well as the Film & Publication Board Amendment Bill, which broadens state power to censor content. The board also noted that the controversial Secrecy Bill could still be signed into law after Parliament recommended President Jacob Zuma give it his final approval, despite vigorous opposition from media and civil society groups. Wan-Ifra has expressed its deep concern that the government is considering a range of measures &#x201c;that will intimidate the press, promote self-censorship and silence criticism.&#x201d; In order to address the shrinking space for independent journalism, Wan-Ifra has urged the South African authorities to adopt a more open, inclusive approach to dialogue and to work with media, legal and civil society organisations to craft legislation that seeks to enable, rather than restrict, a more positive environment for freedom of expression.
