The City of Cape Town and Mpact were awarded the SAPRO Trophy for the Recycled Product of the Year 2015 for their Fifty/50 Wheelie Bin.This biennial competition showcases the ingenuity and creativity our local product designers have and aims to encourage brand owners to consider recycled plastics as a material of choice. Whether they are designing packaging or pallets, shoes or shopping bags, this competition has demonstrated that there is no limitation to where and how recycled plastics can be used. Winners of this year&#x2019;s competition will be announced at a gala dinner in Gauteng during Clean-Up and Recycle SA Week (11-17 September 2017). Product categories In order to encourage even greater participation and entries by local converters and innovators, this year&#x2019;s competition will have the following five distinct product categories: &#x2022; Products made from 100% post-consumer recyclate &#x2022; Products containing a percentage post-consumer recyclate &#x2022; Products made from recycled mixed materials &#x2022; Novel and artistic products - i.e. articles made from discarded plastics products &#x2022; And for the first time, there is also a &#x201c;New Ideas&#x201d; category - anything that can be made from recycled materials. It does not have to be a product as yet, just the idea clearly explained on a poster, mock-ups or a good explanation. A gold, silver and bronze winner will be announced in each of these product categories, which will also acknowledge the recycler of the material, the manufacturer of the product as well as the brand owner in front of the auspicious audience during the gala awards ceremony. The overall winning entry will walk away with the trophy for The Best Recycled Product for 2017.
