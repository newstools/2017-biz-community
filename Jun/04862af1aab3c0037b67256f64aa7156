President of FNL Network Rocco Leo Gaglioti comments, &#x201c;I am very excited to be working with the very talented film maker and founder Adrian Lazarus of Bokeh Fashion Film Festival. This partnership will enable FNL Network to showcase all the films and coverage from the Bokeh Fashion Film Festival on our TV series, Film Corner.

There will be ten events in total each year and they will be hosted in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. The main gala event will now be split over two separate weekends in both Cape Town and Johannesburg in April 2018. This global interest has attracted additional new partners and sponsors keen to participate in this targeted lifestyle activation, which will soon be announced.
