"We apologise to all photographers who have entered already and who were planning to enter going forward,&#x201d; said Digby Wesson of Digger Marketing, which handles the AutObarn SuperHatch communications. &#x201c;The competition concept was created to reward photographers for their hard work at the tracks and to publicise the best shots which we felt would have assisted most photographers in the way of coverage and awareness which could well have related in new business coming from the sponsors, teams, organisers, and track owners and lastly to build awareness around the AutObarn SuperHatch race series for drivers, teams and sponsors, using the competition&#x201d; said Wesson. As of 1 June 2017 entries will not be accepted, all existing entrants will be advised by mail on the status of the competition.
