click to enlarge The Future of HR Awards, being hosted for the third time this year, has just announced its 2017 finalists. The awards, hosted in association with Careers24, recognises South Africa's most outstanding, inspiring and effective leaders in people management strategies and HR innovation - and provides them with a deserving platform to be showcased to both local and international business leaders. This year, the &#x201c;innovation&#x201d; aspect of nominees' entries was particularly scrutinised by the judging panel, against the backdrop of an industry facing more digital disruption than just about any other (thanks to a plethora of recent technological solutions, two-thirds of today's HR professionals worry that their skills will not be needed by employers in the future - on the other hand, HR practitioners who update their skills set accordingly can harness the power of a market for new HR software and tools currently worth $14 billion). Tech aside, people will always remain &#x201c;the heart&#x201d; of HR, and the awards ceremony - scheduled for 20 July at Birchwood Hotel, Johannesburg, also looks to honour HR teams across a whole host of more traditional people-management criteria, as well as recognise &#x201c;people-first&#x201d; organisations and the inspiring leaders men or women at their helm. Tickets can be booked for the evening's celebrations by emailing Nokuthula Bonga on az.oc.ocpot&#64;agnob.n or calling 0860 009 590. The awards and the accompanying Summit (also in association with Careers24), will draw together a host of business leaders, HR thought leaders, partners and sponsors, HR luminaries and the media to take the pulse of HR today - and to share in the excitement around the industry's fast-developing future.
