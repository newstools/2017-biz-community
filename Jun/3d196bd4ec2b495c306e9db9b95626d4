Championed by Artlogic, This is Cape Town and Le BHV/Marais, the showcase presents an opportunity to expose international audiences and buyers to a selection of artisanal South African brands across various design categories namely; fashion, furniture, accessories, beauty, homeware and decor. Trade and export opportunity A project of this proportion, lead by a prominent international retailer is the first of its kind in Paris. Brand South Africa, the Department of Small Business Development, the Department of Arts and Culture, South African Tourism and the Gauteng Growth and Development Agency in South Africa support the South African Exhibition in Paris. &#x201c;Taking our brands into a large international retailing environment moves us closer to our goal of ultimately securing permanent supply contracts between the brands and the store, as well as other buyers in Paris. These brands have been nurtured on home soil through the Sanlam Handmade Contemporary Fair and this trade and export opportunity is just one step in the pursuit of getting our high quality South African products, into homes and stores all across the globe. "This project will craft a progressive narrative around the South African artisanal design market, which is growing and thriving with a new audacity and vigour,&#x201d; explains Mandla Sibeko, director Artlogic.
