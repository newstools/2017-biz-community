The Cannes Lions Glass Lion, also known as the Lion for Change, covers entries for any product or service and designed for any medium, for any commercial or non-commercial client, regardless of the product or service being advertised, or the medium of communication, but must in some way represent a shift towards more positive, progressive and gender-aware communication. They recognise the power of creativity to positively impact not only businesses and brands, but also the world at large. This Lion rewards creative work that rejects gender stereotypes and confronts prejudice and inequality by representing the gendering of individuals people in a progressive or socially conscious way. As a result, the same piece of work can only be entered once into Glass, with all entries into Glass donated to related charities, and there are no categories for Glass. #CannesLions2017: Glass shortlistThe Cannes Lions Glass shortlist has been released, with SA seeing an entry make it to the final round at Cannes Lions 2017...19 hours ago Only 11 awards were handed out, with the Grand Prix awarded to Fearless Girl, which also took home the PR Lions Grand Prix. #CannesLions2017: PR Lions winners!The 64th annual Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity hosted the Cannes PR award ceremony on 19 June 2017...8 hours ago View the full table of winning work below: Glass Lions Winners EntrantTitleClientProductAwardMcCANN NEW YORKFEARLESS GIRLSTATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORSSHE ETFGrand Prix LAW & KENNETH SAATCHI & SAATCHI, Mumbai#GIVEHER5THE AMMADA TRUSTPUBLIC SERVICEGold LionNOMADES, Mexico CityGENDER VIOLENCECERVECER A CUAUHTEMOC MOCTEZUMA HEINEKEN M XICOTECATE BEERGold LionWEBER SHANDWICK, LondonBRUTAL CUTACTIONAID UKFGM AWARENESSSilver LionLEO BURNETT BEIRUT#UNDRESS522ABAAD RESOURCE CENTER FOR GENDER EQUALITYGENDER EQUALITY NGOSilver LionAREA 23, New YorkITBRA &#x2014; THE WEARABLE THAT DETECTS CANCERCYRCADIA HEALTHITBRA/BREAST CANCER SCREENINGSilver LionDENTSU Y&R, TokyoTHE FAMILY WAYRECRUIT LIFESTYLE CO., LTD.SEEMBronze LionJ.
