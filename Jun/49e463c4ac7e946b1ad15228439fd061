The Outdoor Lions celebrate creativity experienced out of home. Entries need to demonstrate ideas that engage in-the-field by leveraging public spaces to telegraph a message or immerse consumers in a brand experience. Y& R SA's 'Frog', 'Snake', 'Bird' and 'Bat' for Johannesburg Zoo made it onto the shortlist in the Public Sector category. Y& R SA's 'Trash Masks Red', 'Trash Masks Blue' and 'Trash Masks Grey' work for Greenpeace Africa also made it onto the Photography shortlist, with additional work by Advantage Y&R Windhoek. Grey Africa's Satellife Satellite Dish Numbers, with Loxyion Connexyion for Multichoice made it onto the shortlist in the Use of Ambient Outdoor category.
