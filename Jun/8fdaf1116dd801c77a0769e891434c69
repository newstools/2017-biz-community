The automatic jitter buffer, adaptive bit rate and forward error correction allows for secure audio streaming with the best possible audio quality.&#x201d; &#x201c;Algoa FM has been at the forefront of digital convergence in broadcasting since our privitisation in 1996. My team is highly innovative in their approach and I am extremely proud of this next phase in remote outside broadcast opportunities for the business,&#x201d; says Dave Tiltmann, Managing Director of Algoa FM. &#x201c;With innovative technology and a brand new look to match, we are extremely happy to have literally &#x201c;cut the umbilical cord&#x201d; and can now do remote outside broadcasts from just about anywhere, anytime!&#x201d;
