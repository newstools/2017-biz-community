Alliance Media has donated 5,000 trees via Trees for the Future to the African continent, and is encouraging staff, suppliers and even clients to do something significant to make a positive contribution to the environment. A few ideas to make a difference on World Environment Day: Plant a tree: We know it's difficult to find space in a metropolitan city, but if you've got space plant an indigenous tree. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: If you're not already into this habit, it's a good day of the year to start. These 3R's are magic mantras when it comes to environmental conservation and sustainable usage. Publicise: Let people know what you plan to do and do it this World Environment Day. Use Twitter hashtags like #StayGreen or #WorldEnvDay and spread the message. </li></li>&#x201c;The old adage of the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is now, made us think why wait &#x2013; let&#x2019;s get started? Alliance Media is invested and committed to this continent, so let&#x2019;s help make sure it will continue to grow and thrive,&#x201d; says Greg Benatar, Sales & Marketing Director, Alliance Media.
