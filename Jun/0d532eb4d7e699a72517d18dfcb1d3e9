Lions Entertainment for Music is part of the overall Entertainment Lions festival. It celebrates creative musical collaborations and original music content. Entries needed to demonstrate original production, promotion or distribution of music for brands and work where a recording artist or platform is innovatively leveraged to communicate with consumers. #CannesLions2017: Entertainment for Music shortlistThe Cannes Lions Entertainment for Music shortlist has been released, with a single SA campaign making the cut in two categories...1 day ago Native VML did just that, with its work for Absolut One Source, with One Source campaign garnering a Silver Lion in the beverages category. Egg Films Cape Town was also responsible for the production work on Grand Prix-winning &#x2018;Original is never finished&#x2019; for Adidas, as Terence Neale directed the work for Johannes Leonardo New York with RSA Films! So, while technically a win for the US, the work was shot in South Africa, by a South African director and South African production company. That sounds like a win to us...
