Matrics are encouraged to shift their thinking from obtaining a formal tertiary education to vocational training, a post-matric study option, which guarantees employment. Richard Rayne, CEO of iLearn, says the organisation has made it its mission to help produce a calibre of graduates that are strong and well equipped to enter the workplace and in turn boost the country&#x2019;s level of employment. &#x201c;Our country&#x2019;s unemployment stats sit at alarming levels and we need to do our bit to decrease that figure. As a provider of learning solutions, we are committed to ensuring that each learner receives a level of training that is recognised on the South African National Qualifications Framework (NQF).&#x201d; A learnership is a vocational and educational programme that links structured learning and work experience in order to obtain a registered qualification. It combines theory and workplace practice into a qualification registered by the NQF. This type of programme allows for greater absorption of knowledge and an opportunity to practice and verify new skills and effectively apply them to business. The organisation is strategically positioning itself to upskill 7,000 candidates across various disciplines over the next three years. Benefits of vocational training How vocational training will benefit the learner: An opportunity to enter the job market and appeal to current and future employers A fixed-term employment contract and generous allowance for the duration of the programme A nationally-recognised qualification.</li></li> Qualities of a learner: Candidates who serve with purpose and who embrace diversity Candidates who are solutions-orientated and performance-driven Candidates with an entrepreneurial spirit </li></li> &#x201c;At the organisation, the learner is at the heart of everything we do and we are committed to creating a learning ecology that will empower people, to empower others. It offers a hyper-personalised approach to learnerships that supports interactive learning. &#x201c;We help companies to identify skills gaps and create learning pathways that encourage continuous employee learning, which aids both career development and business growth,&#x201d; concludes Rayne.
