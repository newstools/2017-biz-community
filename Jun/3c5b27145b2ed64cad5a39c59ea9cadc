MOT South Africa trained 45 Grade 9 learners to be peer educators and youth leaders at their respective high schools in the Western Cape. MOT SA hosts training workshops for educators, youth and volunteers for the implementation of the MOT programmes at Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges, high schools and community organisations. The MOT life-skills training programmes equip young people with the tools - and strengthen their awareness and courage - to manage peer pressure, to believe in themselves and to take responsibility for their own lives and future. MOT focuses strongly on the development of self-confidence, sound values, positive attitude and behaviour, self-leadership and to respect and care for others. Through the MOT programmes, the youth is empowered with courage, resilience and life skills to make good life choices for them to develop to their full potential and become leaders and positive role models in their communities. With its philosophy, programmes and methodology, MOT aims to achieve significant and long-term change in individuals and in the classroom. MOT South Africa partners with high schools, TVET colleges, and communities to achieve its vision of creating a warmer and safer society. Motivational talks During the three-day camp, our youth enjoyed motivational talks presented by the Director for Institutional Management and Governance at the Western Cape Education Department, Makhonsandile Ndzuzo; MOT SA Chairperson, Professor Eltie Links; Chief Director at the DHET Regional Office and MOT SA Board Member, Zozo Siyengo; MOT Brand Ambassadors, International Kung Fu/TaiChi Champion, MJ Li and local singer and songwriter, Janice. MOT Brand Ambassadors, MJ Li and Janice motivate and inspire the youth at the Young MOTivators leadership camp. Ndzuzo addressed the youth and spoke about success, what it means and what it takes to be successful in life: &#x201c;Life will throw curve balls but you must persevere. You are a gardener and you are responsible for your own garden, sowing seed, and weeding. What you plant now will grow later. The choice is yours, so make good choices.&#x201d; Professor Links equipped the youth with knowledge on the importance of relationships and relationship-building: &#x201c;Being part of a family or group gives us responsibilities and we need to adhere to certain values. Taking responsibility leads to success.&#x201d; We may not be able to shape the future for our youth, but as South Africans, we can strengthen and empower the youth to be able to handle any obstacles that they may encounter and to make sound choices. By working proactively with the students and learners, the young MOTivators are trained and equipped with the knowledge and tools to be culture-builders, active citizens and youth leaders at their colleges, high schools and in their communities. Feedback from Young MOTivators: &#x201c;MOT gives hope to a lot of youngsters who feel lost and my thoughts are that they are helping a lot of people.&#x201d; &#x201c;I am now more self-reliant and passionate about life and I&#x2019;ve improved my listening skills.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m now not afraid to reach my goals and I&#x2019;m no longer shy to speak out. I found myself volunteering without being picked to answer.&#x201d; &#x201c;I really felt inspired and motivated, but most of all, the camp made me feel good about myself again.&#x201d; &#x201c;MOT taught me a lot about life and how to tackle certain situations and how to believe in myself. Prof Links&#x2019; speech about relationships was mind opening and wise.&#x201d; &#x201c;I have been motivated and inspired to do more good things and to never give up on my goals.&#x201d; &#x201c;I have joined MOT to change the way of doing things and to stop drinking alcohol. It was the first time I&#x2019;ve talked in front of a lot of people and now I&#x2019;m not shy anymore. I&#x2019;m motivated and have courage.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so excited about motivating, helping and advising others in being positive and believing in themselves and also to be a good person.&#x201d; &#x201c;Before joining MOT, I was not confident. I used to tell myself that no one would look up to me because I did not see myself as a role model. I did not believe in myself, but now I do. Now I&#x2019;m confident and can tell people what I think.&#x201d; MOT colleges in attendance: &#x2022; Boland College, Caledon Campus &#x2022; College of Cape Town, Garden Campus &#x2022; College of Cape Town, Gugulethu Campus &#x2022; College of Cape Town, Pinelands Campus &#x2022; False Bay College, Fish Hoek Campus &#x2022; False Bay College, Khayelitsha Campus &#x2022; False Bay College, Mitchells Plain Campus &#x2022; False Bay College, Muizenberg Campus &#x2022; Northlink College, Goodwood Campus &#x2022; Northlink College, Parow Campus &#x2022; West Coast College, Citrusdal Campus &#x2022; West Coast College, Vredenburg Campus MOT schools in attendance: &#x2022; Buren High School, Ysterplaat &#x2022; Centre of Science and Technology (COSAT), Khayelitsha &#x2022; Desmond Mpilo Tutu High School, Mbekweni in Paarl &#x2022; Ihlumelo High School, Mbekweni in Paarl &#x2022; Simon&#x2019;s Town High School
