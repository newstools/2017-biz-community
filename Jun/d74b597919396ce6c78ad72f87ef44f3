Africa&#x2019;s Travel Indaba &#x2013; South African Tourism&#x2019;s flagship travel trade show, previously known as Indaba &#x2013; will take place from 8 to 10 May 2018 at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban, preceded by a Business Opportunity Networking Day (BONDay) for exhibitors on 7 May. A few days later, from 14 to 17 May 2018, We Are Africa will take place at the Cape Town Stadium, with South African Tourism as the headline partner &#x2013; offering local and international buyers the opportunity to attend both trade shows and sample the cream of what the African travel and tourism marketplace has to offer. A match made in heaven South African Tourism Chief Executive Sisa Ntshona comments on the partnership between the two events: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s incredibly exciting for Africa&#x2019;s Travel Indaba, one of our continent&#x2019;s oldest and most popular travel shows, to have joined hands with the young, passionate and dynamic We Are Africa show to benefit tourism as a whole. &#x201c;We believe it&#x2019;s a match made in heaven, as our shows are united by a common desire to showcase Africa&#x2019;s attractions to the world&#x2019;s blue-chip buyers and thereby get more people travelling to and around our remarkable continent. This pairing of travel show brands will incentivise buyers to attend both shows and gain a 360-degree perspective of the immense breadth and scope of Africa&#x2019;s travel offering within a concentrated two-week timeframe.&#x201d; Ntshona said he was confident that the partnership would yield positive results in telling Africa&#x2019;s tourism story, adding: &#x201c;We look forward to making the two trade shows a collective shopping mecca for buyers looking for the best tourism offerings from Africa.&#x201d;
