With immediate effect, TiMoto, a division of TiAuto Investments, is now the sole wholesaler and distributor of the complete range of Metzeler motorcycle tyres in South Africa and neighbouring territories. TiAuto Investments has an extensive and established distribution network and decades of proven performance as the sole Southern African distributor of a number of big-name wheel, tyre and automotive battery brands. This will translate into greater, more widespread and more immediate availability of the full variety of Metzeler tyres, throughout the Southern African motorcycle dealer network. Metzeler was reportedly one of the first companies to make specialised motorcycle tyres, back in 1892 when motorcycles were first being built. In fact, the company is credited with playing a major role in tyre development for not only the motorcycle but also the bicycle and automotive industries. Since 1978/79, however, the company has focused exclusively on motorcycle tyres.
