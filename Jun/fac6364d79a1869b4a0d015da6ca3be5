The Creative Effectiveness Lions celebrate the measurable impact of creativity. Entries need to demonstrate hard results over the long term: How the work drove tangible business effects, was instrumental to cultural change or integral in the achievement of brand purpose. There are 34 entries on the shortlist. Click here to view the Creative Effectiveness shortlist in full. The Festival of Creativity runs from 17-24 June 2017, with Cinemark the local representatives of Cannes Lions for SA.
