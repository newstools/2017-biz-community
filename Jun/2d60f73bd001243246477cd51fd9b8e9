With an international platform that is fully automated, indaHash revolutionises the process of collaboration between brands and digital influencers. Even though this company was only founded in 2016, it has since gathered over 250,000 influencers from across the world and executed more than 200 campaigns for some of the world&#x2019;s biggest brands, such as Coca-Cola, P&G, McDonald&#x2019;s, and L&#x2019;Oreal. In October 2016, indaHash became a strategic digital partner of MediaCom, who is one of the largest content and media agencies worldwide. Are you ready for the shift in social media? According to indaHash&#x2019;s 2017 International Influencer Report, being a digital influencer is the new profession. An influencer is someone with a certain lifestyle and social status that make a living (or extra income) from their social media skills. According to the report&#x2019;s research, 77% of the consumers claimed that influencers are competition for traditional media. Interestingly, the most prominent influencers mainly engage with online videos and 51% watch little or no television. For them, the most opinion-forming sources are other influencers and social media users &#x2013; only 1% chose radio, 3% press, and 5% television. Due to this important shift in the market, MediaCom and indaHash decided to host an event in Johannesburg to explain the impact of automated influencer marketing at scale on platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. The day will cover thought-provoking topics such as how technology is disrupting traditional career paths, the growing phenomenon of the &#x2018;everypreneur&#x2019;, digital influencers as the new broadcasters, and even an artificial intelligence demonstration. Over and above MediaCom and indaHash experts, speakers will include representatives from event partners such as Nicola Cooper & Associates, Between 10 and 5, and InJozi Digital Design. Due to an overwhelming number of requests, additional seats have been made available to the event for media and the public. Event details: Date: 14 June 2017 Time: 9:30am - 12:30pm Venue: Gathere, 2nd Floor, 11 Kramer Road, Kramerville, Sandton, Johannesburg. Event video: Are you ready, Johannesburg?
