Dmitry OkorokovAbout ten years ago we were in a similar situation &#x2013; waiting anxiously for the next great technological advancement. However, what developed was the evolution of existing technologies being used for new and different applications. Wireless technology has come full circle and there are now a number of examples where it has become the preferred &#x2013; and best &#x2013; connectivity solution. We have deployed thousands of networks across the globe that are a true testimony to the reliability of wireless technology, whether for simply connecting two remote locations, or providing a complete platform for homeland security and other mission-critical applications. Key advantage is geography The key advantage over wired networks is geography &#x2013; the landscape. In many countries, including South Africa, where the terrain limits the possibility of land-based networks, there really is no other option but to use wireless. One of our most successful projects is a well-established internet service provider (ISP) based in Algeria which offers connectivity to enterprises such as energy companies, manufacturers of all types, telecoms operators, and education establishments. We successfully migrated its entire legacy WiMAX* network, allowing it to serve even more customers and significantly add value to its own business models. While the flexibility of the wireless solution facilitates seamless integration, regardless of the complexity and reach, the applications of the future will, I believe, shock the world and set the scene for what lies ahead. *WiMAX: Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
