Filmed along South Africa&#x2019;s ridiculously beautiful Wild Coast, it&#x2019;s the story of a man&#x2019;s journey to find himself - with his Staffie. In its first week online, the ad racked up over 300k views and more than 2,000 shares on Facebook alone, where fans hailed it as "the best ad ever", admitted it "brought tears to my eyes" and compared it to Jock of the Bushveld. 2OceansVibe called it &#x201c;a wonderful, heart-warming advert,&#x201d; adding, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s awfully sad it&#x2019;s only 45 seconds,&#x201d; while Channel24 said the ad &#x201c;tugs at the heartstrings and makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. No, we&#x2019;re not crying. It&#x2019;s just raining on our face.&#x201d; &#x201c;It feels like a lifetime ago we were hiking 20kms carrying gear, shoulder deep in water, chomping down on strawberry whirls and Camilla&#x2019;s delicious evening meals,&#x201d; laughs Jason. He thanks everyone who made the job such a success, especially lead actor Chris Fisher; Mortimer Harvey&#x2019;s Christopher Potter and Karolin Steenkamp; RCL Foods' Aamina Shaik and Geran Moodliar; and Benson the Staffie, who Jason says deserves &#x201c;a gigantic shout out and head rub.&#x201d; What Facebook is saying: &#x201c;Yes!!
