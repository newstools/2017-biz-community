Next Web selected the app among the 2016 Top 30 best global start-ups in New York. A year earlier, the European Commission also picked it among the four best Education Technology projects. With the programme, children can participate in daily 15 minute sessions, which can be performed anywhere, including on the drive back from school or before soccer or hockey practice. More than 32,000 children in over 70 countries &#x2013; 94% of which have seen an improvement in their calculation, reasoning and problem-solving skills thanks to the short daily classes, have used it. Smartick uses the latest artificial intelligence to adapt to the child&#x2019;s learning style, quickly addressing areas where the child needs to improve on. Once he or she is fully versed and competent, the app then moves the child to the next level, unlike paper-based programmes, which force the child to go through a pre-defined path for all kids, no matter what may have already been mastered. Here, they work on a personalised curriculum &#x2013; one that is sure to keep them from dozing off from boredom or turning their attention to something else. Smartick has a team of 45 engineers, mathematicians, pedagogues, psychologists and educators around the world, ready to encourage your kids to fall in love with maths. &#x201c;We are going to show that if school-age children enhance mathematics and co-train their cognitive skills, in an adaptive and intelligent way, we will maximise their school performance. We want to bring their performance to a higher level in South Africa,&#x201d; said co-founders of Smartick, Daniel Gonzalez de Vega and Javier Arroyo.
