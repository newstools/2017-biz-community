Lions Glass, also known as the Lion for Change, covers entries for any product or service and designed for any medium, for any commercial or non-commercial client, regardless of the product or service being advertised, or the medium of communication, but must in some way represent a shift towards more positive, progressive and gender-aware communication. They recognise the power of creativity to positively impact not only businesses and brands, but also the world at large. This Lion rewards creative work that rejects gender stereotypes and confronts prejudice and inequality by representing the gendering of individuals people in a progressive or socially conscious way. As a result, the same piece of work can only be entered once into Glass, with all entries into Glass donated to related charities, and there are no categories for Glass. Vagina Varsity for Libresse, entered by Net#Work BBDO Johannesburg, made it onto the Glass shortlist. It had production work by Zootee Studios Cape Town, with media handled by Mediology Johannesburg and PR by ByDesign Communications. Click here to view the Lions Glass shortlist in full. The Festival of Creativity runs from 17-24 June 2017, with Cinemark the local representatives of Cannes Lions for SA.
