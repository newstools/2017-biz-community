The Ministry of Commerce of the People&#x2019;s Republic of China (PRC) hosted the event and the Trade Development Bureau of Ministry of Commerce of the PRC organised it. &#x201c;This is the first time that China&#x2019;s Guangxi region is holding business matchmaking and product information sessions in South Africa,&#x201d; explained Catherine Larkin, CEO of CVLC, the company that facilitated media representation at the event. &#x201c;This session is a trading platform that aims to achieve trade and economic benefits for both South Africa and China. It promotes multi-exchanges in bilateral economic and trade relations, culture, technology and more.&#x201d; Ideally located on the coast, the Guangxi region is rich in natural resources including tin, manganese, antimony and lime. It is also rich in timber and forestry resources. Guangxi produces a large number of cash crops, including sugarcane, palm-oil seeds, bananas, pineapple and rosin. The region is also strong in a number of other industries, including passenger vehicles, heavy mining machinery, as well electrical equipment and electronics items. Given its coastal location, the region has also developed a strong chemical and oil refinery sector in recent years.
