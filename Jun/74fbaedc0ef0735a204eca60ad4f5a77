 New Generation Awards websiteStephen Paxton, MD of the awards, says, &#x201c;We are delighted to have such a strong panel this year. Our awards are always only as good as our judging panel and we are privileged to have some of South Africa's best experts on-board.&#x201d; There is a mathematical approach to the judging &#x2013; the adjudication process sees each entry marked by at least four judges, measuring them against criteria such as innovation, creativity, strategy, content, results and sales. Judges do not adjudicate any categories into which their agencies have entered.
