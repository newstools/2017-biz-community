Open Book Festival has established itself as one of South Africa&#x2019;s most innovative and leading book festivals. Last year, nearly 10,000 people attended the Festival&#x2019;s 125 events featuring 251 authors and it has been shortlisted twice for the London Book Fair Excellence Awards. It is committed to creating a platform to celebrate South African writers, as well as hosting top international authors. The Festival strives to instil an interest in and love of reading among young attendees, while the programme is designed to engage, entertain and inspire conversations among Festival goers long after the event. &#x201c;In addition to announcing the first round of incredible international authors for Open Book Festival 2017, we are inviting people to help be a part of it and launching a Thundafund campaign for this year&#x2019;s festival,&#x201d; says Festival Director, Mervyn Sloman. &#x201c;Anyone who works on major events will have an understanding of the budgetary challenges and current financial climate that are part and parcel of the sector. Open Book is no different and while we continue to work with key sponsors, we are inviting people who recognise the value of the festival to get involved and support us, so we can retain our independence and continue to put on an event of the scale and calibre visitors have come to expect. You can support the campaign for as little as R100 and every Rand makes a difference.&#x201d; &#x201c;We are excited to be announcing our first round of international authors and have again compiled a useful guide of their books so you can start reading now.&#x201d; Author: Ay&#x1ecd;&#x0300;ba&#x0301;mi Ade&#x0301;ba&#x0301;y&#x1ecd;&#x0300; (Nigeria) Books include: Stay With Me Why we&#x2019;re excited: Ay&#x1ecd;&#x0300;ba&#x0301;mi was shortlisted for the 2017 Baileys Women&#x2019;s Prize for Fiction.
