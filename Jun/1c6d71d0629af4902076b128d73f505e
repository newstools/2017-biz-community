This first of its kind in SA, Capsule Fest is a street culture festival that aims to be the mecca for all urban culture brands, artists, designers, influencers, consumers and stakeholders. The objective of the event is to offer a credible platform that celebrates SA street culture in all its forms. Taking place on Saturday, 16 September 2017 at the Mary Fitzgerald Square in Johannesburg, the fest will host a music concert amongst an array of street culture activities including the following: &#x2022; Charity Celebrity Basketball Tournament &#x2022; Skate park &#x2022; Brand pop-up stores &#x2022; Art installations &#x2022; Customising booths &#x2022; Beer garden and Food village &#x2022; Gaming area &#x2022; VIP deck The concert which is the biggest attraction of the festival will be supported by a myriad of over 30 local artists and DJs. With two music stages: The Main stage for the big name acts and the WavesXV stage for up and coming indie acts and DJs. Confirmed headliners are SA&#x2019;s own Nasty C alongside A$AP Mob's member A$AP Ferg. They will be supported by the likes of Sho Madjozi, DJ Speedsta, Da Les, Gemini Major and Yanga. Full lineup to be announced closer to the fest date. &#x201c;The street culture scene in SA has never been this big and impactful, yet the industry lacks a safe and family friendly event that brings all these street culture elements together in one place", says Sportscene's Head of Marketing Jonathan Muir. &#x201c;We believe the Capsule Fest offers the market just that and hence we're super excited to host the first of what will hopefully be many editions to come&#x201d;.
