 everythingpossible via 123RF&#x201c;Africa has its own nuances, and its complex cultures within its different countries hold a myriad of challenges for established businesses and startups looking to enter its new markets,&#x201d; says Kimberley Clare Ogden RubiBlue MD and founder of Data Sight. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t understand consumers in the territory you&#x2019;re entering, you&#x2019;re setting yourself up to fail.&#x201d; &#x201c;There are currently 293.8 million smartphone users across the continent, and according to research firm Ovum, the smartphone penetration rate will grow at 52.9% year-on-year. It&#x2019;s these smartphone users we will use to collect data from and create a picture of Africa&#x2019;s consumers,&#x201d; adds Ogden. Subscriber rewards Data Sight subscribers will be surveyed and rewarded with data or airtime vouchers upon completion of question sets, as well as other partnered value-added service (VAS) providers across Africa. &#x201c;Creating and owning its data, and the ability to carry out surveys on demand from a uniquely dynamic platform, Data Sight will partner with organisations and entrepreneurs to furnish them with the insight they need,&#x201d; adds Ogden. &#x201c;Most businesses don&#x2019;t have access or the expertise to collect and analyse vast amounts of data. Which is where our experience and expertise adds value.&#x201d;
