The expedition will begin in Nome, a town located in the far-western area of Alaska, with a planned arrival 45 to 50 days later in Nuuk, Greenland, on the East coast of the Davis Strait. His solo challenge would create a new record recognised by the World Sailing Record Council. The Northwest Passage, exclusively used by motor boats so far, is only open a few weeks a year, which is why Bourgnon has asked GEFCO to provide its logistical support, enabling him to transport his catamaran from the port of Antwerp (Belgium) to Nome under extremely tight deadlines, so that he can weigh anchor in time and take advantage of the ice thawing. The 6.3 meter-long catamaran arrived by cargo ship in Seattle, Washington, USA in separate pieces, and was then shipped by fast-line ship to Anchorage, Alaska. It was finally boarded on a Hercules C-130 cargo plane to arrive in Nome on 26 June 2017. Bourgnon will get begin his 7,500km solo trip in early July using the sun and stars as his only source of navigation. He will sail his catamaran, without a cockpit, purely under power generated by the wind, along the ice floe, close to polar bears and sea mammals.
