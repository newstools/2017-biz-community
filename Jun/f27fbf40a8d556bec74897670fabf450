GoMyWay.com is Nigeria's leading indigenous rideshare platform that connects people with the same planned journey, to share car rides together as a way to cut down transport cost and build connections. GoMyWay.com also boasts of an average seat occupancy of 2.8 people per ride from about 1.8 in their first year, indicating that car owners on the platform are being connected to more passengers than before. It is evident that more Nigerians are beginning to embrace this innovation aimed at fixing some of the issues around transportation. In celebration of their 2nd anniversary this month, the GoMyWay team have announced the start of an annual Rideshare Week Campaign (#RideShareWeekNG) across the country. The week-long campaign will be the first in Nigeria and is aimed at encouraging people to share rides together as an alternative mode of transportation, as well as creating public awareness on the benefits of ridesharing. According to GoMyWay&#x2019;s CEO, Damilola Teidi - &#x201c;Looking back, it is interesting to see how much we have grown. We have seen an increasing acceptance of this concept of ridesharing by Nigerians and are more than glad to be at the forefront. More so, it has given us the courage to push further in our quest to make GoMyWay a mainstream transport option; which is why this year, we are launching the rideshare week. The goal is that the Rideshare week will become bigger every year, and ultimately, many more Nigerians will get involved in the ridesharing culture.&#x201d; Prizes and other competitions also form part of the rideshare week promotion.
