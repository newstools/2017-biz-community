With one of Cape Town&#x2019;s worst storms in years and fires in Knysna that have left a number of people homeless, brands across the country have stepped in to help. To indicate an idea of scale, both FNB and ABSA have donated R10m each to the cause. But we must ask ourselves: What is the best way to do this that not only helps people in need, but also meets consumer expectations of the brand? We know that brands doing good is something consumers now expect. With this in mind, we used our proprietary online briefing tool, The Greenhouse, to survey our South African grass community to get their opinions about cause marketing and what brands should do to get it right. This quote from Wanda, 22, sums it up so well: [Cause marketing] gives the brand a bit of humanity! DO: Align your cause marketing efforts with your brand or product offering. Kara, 19: Their core values [have to] relate with the cause! In a world as turbulent as ours, there are an endless number of causes or problems to be solved. Finding one that aligns with your brand is logical from a marketing and branding perspective, but also makes sense to consumers. Consider a pet food brand like Montego, collecting food for animals in Knysna or DHL offering free delivery of goods to Knysna to help with relief efforts. This not only helps but also highlights their product or service. To turn this example around, it makes no sense that a pet food brand (for example) should look to more &#x2018;human&#x2019; based causes. DON&#x2019;T: Blow your own horn (too much). Sibusiso, 25: [They overstep the mark when] they over-brand and care more about their visibility in the crisis rather than the help that they provide. This is such a difficult line to walk for brands. Doing good is fast becoming a hygiene factor, especially for millennial consumers, but doing it in the right way is vitally important. Many of us were raised with the idea that you shouldn&#x2019;t advertise your own charity or doing good, but the rules are different for brands. If you don&#x2019;t tell consumers about your efforts, they won&#x2019;t know about them &#x2013; you can&#x2019;t rely on word of mouth. The trick: Focusing on the outcomes of your actions, rather than just &#x2018;you&#x2019; as the brand. DO: Make your efforts about actions, not just writing a cheque or donating. Leverne, 25: Saying you sponsor a charity once a year is not enough! It&#x2019;s too easy to simply write off a percentage of sales or &#x2018;donate a memorial bench&#x2019;, as Thomas Kolster (writer of Goodvertising: Creative Advertising That Cares) likes to say. Consumers need to see you really getting your hands dirty as a brand and helping to create real change. While large donations may sound impressive on paper, what exactly does R100,000 buy to help people in need? What are the real-world steps that have been taken? DON&#x2019;T: Enter into cause marketing half-heartedly; consumers will see through you. Sinawo, 25: Brands need to first understand their target market and from there connect with them through empathy. If you fail to meet your consumers in an empathetic way and realise their needs, they will reject your efforts. Cause marketing is not something that should just be an ad hoc tactical push, but should be built into your marketing efforts from the get go. It&#x2019;s not about using &#x2018;what&#x2019;s left&#x2019; of the marketing budget to help out, it&#x2019;s about looking at your brand and what it stands for, then aligning it with a cause that can really help people and the planet. In summary, cause marketing is not going away any time soon. And as mentioned above, it is fast becoming a hygiene factor, especially with younger consumers. It&#x2019;s not a question of if your brand should look to cause marketing but really a question of when. This final quote is all you need to know. Nonto, 28: [When a brand helps with a cause] I feel like I can trust the brand more, I somehow feel I can rely on them. That sounds like something we&#x2019;re all striving for.
