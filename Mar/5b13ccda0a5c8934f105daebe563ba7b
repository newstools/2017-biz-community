HP Z2 Mini Workstation is reportedly three times more powerful than a business-class PC mini, the height of an espresso cup and the epitome of elegance. &#x201c;Style over substance is detested, substance over style is scorned upon. However, like many other industries, designers can fall into the trap of using sub-standard technology&#x201d;, says Fulvio Don , value computing area country manager for HP Africa. Don says that sometimes, it&#x2019;s easier to stick with what you know than branch out and experiment with something new, only to be disappointed. In part, this could be the reason why some 2.9 million CAD users are still not using workstations - turbo-charged, professional grade computers, with rapid microprocessors, large amounts of RAM and special features, such as professional graphics. In the absence of workstations, designers could be competing with productivity bottlenecks, frustrating flexibility issues and challenges producing anything beyond 2D design. They may have hit the wall, inspiration-wise, no thanks to limited desk space, outdated technology and the sort of background noise that distracts rather than aids concentration. The best things come in small packages HP&#x2019;s Z2 Mini pushes the boundaries at 2.3 inches (5.8cm) tall, meaning professionals can fully immerse themselves in their creations, without cluttering their workspace and becoming overrun by cables and large, unpleasant black boxes. &#x201c;Small is desirable but it shouldn&#x2019;t come at the expense of functionality. By refusing to compromise on performance, we packed a wagon load of functionality into a sleek, silver-grey octagonal powerhouse. We also added a discrete graphics card for blistering 3D design with the Performance model version, whisper-quiet acoustics and enough ports to support 4-6 displays,&#x201d; says Don .
