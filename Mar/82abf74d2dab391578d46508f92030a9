The commercial shows a dream-like sequence conjured by that first sip of Nederburg, as it triggers memories, reveries and flights of fancy, demonstrating experiences offered by every bottle of Nederburg. Swopping the cerebral for the sensory, it encourages viewers to discover more about Nederburg: D -Mari Shaw, Nederburg&#x2019;s global marketing spokesperson, says it is a great achievement for Nederburg&#x2019;s commercial to have been recognised by global creative industry leaders and that their creative agency, TBWA, together with director Bruno Bossi delivered exceptional work in producing an impactful piece of creative to stand out in the wine category, known for much parity. The commercial forms part of the brand&#x2019;s new communication campaign, introduced globally during the course of 2016, intended to reach and relate better to new wine consumers worldwide, while strengthening ties with existing brand supporters in a premium, but more provocative and arresting way. It will be flighted in selected Ster-Kinekor cinemas across South Africa over the coming months.
