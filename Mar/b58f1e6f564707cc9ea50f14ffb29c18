Now, in a bid to assist companies to anticipate the disruptive forces emerging in different industries, Dion has designed a new Flux Trends Innovation Laboratory masterclass to help companies both identify the disruptive trends headed their way, and plan a counter-strategy to drive their business through the changes ahead.
