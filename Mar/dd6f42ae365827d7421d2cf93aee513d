 dolgachov via 123RFNielsen head emerging markets thought leadership, Ailsa Wingfield comments, &#x201c;As consumers move up the economic ladder, they&#x2019;re attracted to aspirational brands that signal they&#x2019;ve achieved a certain level of success. Nonetheless, for many, disposable incomes remain limited and for these consumers, trusted brands provide an assurance of quality, minimising the risk of wasting money on a product that doesn&#x2019;t fulfil expectations.&#x201d; For those local respondents in the study who indicated that they are significantly or somewhat better off financially, the products/services that are more accessible to them today, versus five years ago, are improved technology (72%), better education (49%) and more premium products (35%). For South Africans, sentiment is not necessarily income-dependent. With only 45% of respondents reporting they&#x2019;re able to spend freely or comfortably purchase items that they want, 54% cite premium products worth the money and 50% because these products make them feel good. Although, brand trust remains integral to a purchase, 59% believe that premium claims are a way for a brand to just charge more money. The route for South African&#x2019;s to engage and try new premium products stems from recommendations from friends and family and television advertising, both at 44%, along with their own research (45%) and from online advertising (35%). Wingfield counters, &#x201c;When launching new products, brands need to align their media tactics with the product&#x2019;s core value proposition and the target audience via the relevant media platform. What is a premium product? When asking respondents about the key aspects that make a product premium to them, 64% said it is made with high-quality ingredients or materials, 57% said it is from a well-known or trusted brand and 54% said it offers superior function or performance. Only 29% of local consumers cited a product as premium because it was expensive &#x2013; a clear warning to companies who push up prices without providing a clear value proposition to support the change. South African consumers aren&#x2019;t just trading up on big-ticket purchases; they&#x2019;re also going premium on everyday items. For fast-moving consumer goods, everyday consumables rise to the top of the list of categories for which respondents most often say they&#x2019;re willing to trade up. While electronics and clothing/shoes top the list (cited by 44% and 42%, respectively), respondents are also willing to consider trading up for better meat or seafood (41%), coffee and tea (34%), and dairy (33%), with oral, body and hair care, deodorant and vitamins all coming in at 31%. It&#x2019;s more than price In a world where conscious consumption is going mainstream, many consumers are buying based on how products make them feel and products with an environmental benefit justify a higher price tag for as many as 86% of South African respondents; while 77% are willing to pay premium (more than average) for products that are socially responsible. Roughly eight in 10 South African respondents will willingly pay a premium for products made with organic or all natural ingredients (82%) while 88% are willing to pay more for a product that offers or does something no other product on the market does. &#x201c;Beyond basic-need products, premium products tap directly into a desire for products that provide specialised, enhanced or exclusive benefits. But delivering on consumers&#x2019; expectations of the experience remains critical and the most successful premium products are those that perform an important job for which previously available solutions were unsatisfactory or non-existent.&#x201d; Best practices Brands wanting to capitalise on the rising appetite for premium products in South Africa and increase their bottom lines by putting a premium on premium-focused innovation will need to create a highly differentiated offering that resolves a real consumer struggle. &#x201c;What will remain vital will be to ensure premium products lives up to their promise, that the price is right based on consumers&#x2019; value perceptions and that its marketing continues to resonate emotionally,&#x201d; concludes Wingfield.
