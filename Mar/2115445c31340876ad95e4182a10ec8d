The winning B-Boy of this year&#x2019;s Red Bull BC One finals will represent South Africa on 4 November 2017 at the BC One world stage in Amsterdam. The 16 dancers will be made up of wild cards - these are dancers that automatically progress to the finals based on their performance during the course of the year - as well as the top dancers selected from the Last Chance Cypher. Competition changes As the new instalment comes, so do some changes. This year&#x2019;s edition is going back to the core of what breaking is all about &#x2013; the culture of one-on-one battles - eliminating regional cyphers and hosting one national qualifier (Last Chance Cypher) on 27 April in Cape Town, allowing dancers from all over the country a chance to compete. This year dancers will have the opportunity to be mentored by Hong 10, International BC One All-star, at a public dance workshop on 28 April and get to prove their skills for a chance to be in the national final. Three-time reigning champ and current holder of the Red Bull BC One South Africa title Brandon Peterson, AKA &#x2018;The Curse&#x2019;, is no stranger to the process of winning the local competition. &#x201c;Try and be yourself as much as possible. I know it's easier said than done when there's so much pressure going up against the top 15 b-boys from around the country with the chance to fly to the World Final,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remember why you started dancing and represent that feeling.&#x201d; www.redbullbcone.com
