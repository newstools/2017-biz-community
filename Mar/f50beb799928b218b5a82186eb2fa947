Currently touring and writing in the US, GoodLuck are set to release "I&#x2019;ve Been Thinking About You" to the world on 31 March. The track, already a hit in South Africa since 2016, will be released alongside a pacey dance floor remix from Girls Love DJs & Boris Smith. Multi-instrumental sounds "GoodLuck are something of a phenomenon in South Africa, having clocked up eight chart number one&#x2019;s in the past four years and amassed over four million Spotify plays of their ground-breaking, multi-instrumental sounds. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve Been Thinking About You&#x2019; combines sublime vocals with subtle, progressive drums and piano chords &#x2013; playing with offbeat rhythms and electronic samples as it gathers intensity," says Ultra Music Records. International management, Row Weber & Marcello Pagin said, &#x201c;Working in the entertainment industry for more than 19 years, I know when we have something special. This project will make waves beyond Cape Town and South Africa. Glad they chose us to be part of this ride. GoodLuck&#x2019;s performance is one that has opened the proverbial Pandora&#x2019;s box on what audiences around the world will be demanding in years to come. Electronic music has never felt more real.&#x201d; goodlucklive.com
