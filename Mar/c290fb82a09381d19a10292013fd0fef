The brand recently launched new 660ml packaging and wanted to create a campaign encouraging engagement with the new product. The campaign is multifaceted, and Young Gun Films&#x2019; task was to assist in generating video content for social media platforms. The video revolves around a Castle Lite launch competition, in which entrants can win one of three BMW 325Is cars &#x2013; highly popular with the target market and known locally as the &#x2018;Gusheshe&#x2019; (hurry up). The prize vehicles have been fully restored and accessorised in true Castle Lite style. Dubbed the 'GUSHESHE RAP SESSIONS&#x2019;, the production features local celebrities Cassper Nyovest, Deep Fried Man and DJ Warras. It follows a similar structure to the very popular 'Carpool Karaoke&#x2019;, as Deep Fried Man and Cassper Nyovest cruise the streets of Johannesburg, chatting about the history of the Gusheshe and Cassper&#x2019;s song of the same title. They pick up DJ Warras along the way and the fun continues. The video has generated over 300,000 views since its upload two weeks ago, once again illustrating the power and reach of video.
