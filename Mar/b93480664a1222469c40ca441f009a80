They were not disappointed: with a total of 10 Bookmark Pixel trophies in the bag across a wide range of categories, Hellocomputer left the awards with wide smiles and tired arms. Its Testi-monials campaign with FCB Cape Town for CANSA proved yet again to be a judges&#x2019; favorite adding five Pixel trophies to its tally, including Silver for its social media campaign. Other campaigns that brought in metal were &#x2018;Decoding The Glenlivet Cipher&#x2019;, the &#x2018;Lexus Website v2.5&#x2019; and the Toyota &#x2018;The Toughererest VR Test Drive&#x2019;, proving that Hellocomputer continues to push the boundaries of digital campaigns beyond what is deemed possible. Each win at the annual event, which celebrates all things amazing in the local digital space, is worth that much more given that the level of quality digital work in South Africa is growing significantly each year. Group Managing Director, David Moffatt, said: &#x201c;The Bookmarks remains an important benchmark for us as it values efficacy as much as creativity. We stand by producing work that has a quantifiable and positive impact on our clients&#x2019; businesses. So, we are thrilled to have been recognised with 10 awards across multiple categories.&#x201d;
