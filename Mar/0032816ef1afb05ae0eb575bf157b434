Previous winners of the African Responsible Tourism Awards The awards recognise African organisations that offer a shining example of how tourism can benefit the local people, the environment, and destinations. The awards are part of a family of regional Responsible Tourism Awards which culminate each year with World Responsible Tourism Day at WTM in London. This year, the longlist names tourism organisations from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, South Africa, Botswana and Namibia. Longlisted organisations compete in seven categories, among them habitat and species conservation, engaging people and culture, poverty reduction and a new category in 2017 - the best responsible event. &#x201c;The quality of entries which have made it through to the longlist this year confirms the power of responsible tourism as a force for good in Africa. Each and every one of these organisations is playing an important role in championing responsible tourism. We&#x2019;ve reviewed the information from the first round entry forms, and are excited about the possibilities,&#x201d; says Heidi van der Watt, founder of the African awards and director of Better Tourism Africa. Judging The longlisted organisations will now be rigorously questioned and their submissions reviewed by the judging team. Chair of Judges, Professor Harold Goodwin says: "The field for the 2017 African Responsible Tourism Awards (ARTA) is even stronger than previous years &#x2013; and that takes some doing! Those longlisted have been invited to complete a detailed questionnaire, we'll take up references and make some inquiries. On judging day we'll identify those that demonstrate the difference that taking responsibility can make, and have the capacity to educate and inspire others to be more responsible." The general public can also offer support or otherwise for longlisted organisations by emailing moc.sdrawamsiruotelbisnopsernacirfa&#64;suotklat . Based on all the evidence, the independent judging team, made up of industry experts, will debate the entries and select the shortlist and winners. The shortlist will be announced on 7 April 2017. The 2017 African Responsible Tourism Awards winners will be announced at a ceremony that will be held on Thursday 20 April 2017 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. The ceremony is part of the responsible tourism programme at WTM Africa, which takes place from 19 to 21 April 2017. Carol Weaving, managing director for Reed Exhibitions, organiser of WTM Africa, says: &#x201c;WTM Africa is now firmly established on the African travel and tourism event calendar. Responsible Tourism is a cornerstone of WTM Africa and integral to the success of tourism on the continent. All stakeholders have a duty to ensure education, sustainability, and authenticity when promoting the unique experiences that Africa has to offer. We look forward to an exciting third edition of the African Responsible Tourism Awards, here in Cape Town at the CTICC at WTM Africa.&#x201d; The 2017 ARTA longlist &#x2022; African Bush Camps &#x2022; African Impact &#x2022; All Out Africa &#x2022; Basecamp Explorer &#x2022; Blood Lions&#x2122; &#x2022; Bushfire &#x2022; Coffee Shack Backpackers &#x2022; Damaraland Camp & the Torra Conservancy &#x2022; Gamewatchers Safaris &#x2022; Great Plains Conservation &#x2022; Green Girls in Africa &#x2022; Ilha Blue Island Safaris &#x2022; Influence Tours &#x2022; Isibindi Africa Lodges &#x2022; Khaya Volunteer Projects &#x2022; Kwandwe Private Game Reserve &#x2022; LEO Africa &#x2022; Maasai Olympics &#x2022; Maboneng Township Arts Experience &#x2022; Maboneng Township Arts Experience Festival &#x2022; Mashujaa Peace Walk &#x2022; Panthera Africa &#x2022; Save Foundation &#x2022; Serena Hotels &#x2022; Simien Lodge &#x2022; Sterkspruit Community Art Centre Tele Bridge Race &#x2022; Thanda Safari &#x2022; The Backpack &#x2022; Tour de Tuli &#x2022; Tzaneen Country Lodge &#x2022; Uniglobe Lets Go Travel &#x2022; Uthando &#x2022; Warrior On Wheels Foundation &#x2022; Wilderness Safaris &#x2022; Wildlife ACT
