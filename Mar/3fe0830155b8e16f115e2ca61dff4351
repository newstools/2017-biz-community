Sunu also took home a Silver Craft award for Online Video Production for the Native VML campaign, which won three more Silvers for Integrated Multiplatform Campaign, Content Strategy and Digital Campaign, as well as Bronzes for Digital Strategy and Native Advertising. With seven awards from its 14 nominations, One Source was both the most awarded and most nominated advertising campaign at this year&#x2019;s Bookmarks. A truly pan-African affair, the One Source music video was shot in Ghana and featured Ghana&#x2019;s Sarkodie and Zeal from VVIP alongside Kenya&#x2019;s Victoria Kimani, among others. The music video was nominated for a Metro FM Award and featured on multiple Best Music Video of 2016 lists. Absolut didn&#x2019;t just sponsor the music video, but backed the whole album, which went on to top the iTunes charts.
