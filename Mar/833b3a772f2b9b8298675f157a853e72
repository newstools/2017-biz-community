Around 20 million bags are mislaid in airports around the world every year, and in London alone, 50,000 mobile phones get left behind in taxis annually. South Africa is no different, with thousands of personal belongings making its way into Lost & Found containers nationwide every year. HomingPIN offers an innovative solution to this global problem with the HomingPIN tag. HomingPIN offers baggage loops with tags, key rings, and stickers that have a unique identification number on them. This number gets activated online prior to using the tag and is linked to the owner&#x2019;s email address and cellphone number. If someone finds a cellphone, keys, baggage, or any other item that has a HomingPIN tag on it, they can easily notify the owner by visiting HomingPIN and entering the unique identification number, as well as their contact details. The owner is immediately notified via SMS and email and is able to contact the founder to retrieve their belongings. Finders are not given the owner&#x2019;s contact details, however, so it is up to the owner to make contact first. HomingPIN is integrated with the worldwide World Tracer system, which all baggage handlers have access to. For airlines, HomingPIN will instantly provide information on the bag&#x2019;s whereabouts when it is found. The airline will then contact the owner to arrange transfer of the goods. What&#x2019;s more, is that HomingPIN can provide reasonably-priced transportation of your found goods, from anywhere in the world. HomingPIN tags, stickers, and key rings allow you to tag a variety of items including, but not limited to, luggage, laptop computers, mobile phones, keys, wallets and passports. Easy-to-use and practical, they&#x2019;re a life-saver for the whole family. With this handy tool, lost goods have a much better chance of being returned to their owners, and owners have peace of mind too. HomingPIN packs are available at select Cape Union Mart Stores and online at Takealot.
