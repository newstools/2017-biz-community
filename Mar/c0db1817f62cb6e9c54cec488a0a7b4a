The production of the iconic Citi Golf at the Volkswagen manufacturing factory in Uitenhage ended in 2009 after 25 years of giving mobility freedom to many South African customers. During that time, the Uitenhage plant produced over 377,000 units - many of which are still used on our roads for people&#x2019;s daily commute. In 2010, Volkswagen launched Polo Vivo to replace Citi Golf as the market leader in the compact passenger car segment. In the past six years, Polo Vivo has reportedly been the best-selling passenger model in South Africa and has to date sold 229,300. "There is no better way to celebrate the success of the Polo Vivo as the best-selling passenger car in South Africa than to pay homage to its iconic predecessor, Citi Golf. The three colours of Red, Yellow and Blue are synonymous with the classic Citi Golf and it was fitting for us to use them as the only colours for Citi Vivo. Citi Vivo is a special edition with about 2000 units planned," said Stefan Mecha, director: Sales and Marketing at Volkswagen Group South Africa.
