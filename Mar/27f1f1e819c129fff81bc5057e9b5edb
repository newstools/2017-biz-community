This is the view of Richard Rayne - CEO of South African learning solutions company, iLearn - who explains that there are tangible gains to be made that range from yearly rebates and boosted B-BBEE scores to strategically setting your business on a road to success. &#x201c;Firstly, it&#x2019;s important for businesses ranging from the largest corporations to qualifying SMEs to really understand the role of the SETAs,&#x201d; comments Rayne, &#x201c;The context of addressing skills shortages in South Africa is far from just a government concern. It impacts directly on the present and future achievements of businesses, big and small.&#x201d; In March 2000, government established 22 industry-specific SETAs in order to: Identify skills development needs in each sector; Facilitate the development and implementation of strategic sector skills development plans; Develop and administer learnerships that go beyond &#x2018;blue-collar&#x2019; trades; Undertake quality assurance to ensure training providers meet the agreed standards for education and training within the national qualifications framework; and to pay out grants.</li></li></li>Rayne points out that companies who have registered with their SETA and executed training according to plans, including approved learnerships, stand to claim back up to 70% of the portion of their Skills Development Levy (SDL) paid over to SARS every year. &#x201c;What many companies don&#x2019;t realise is that the SETA&#x2019;s administration absorbs only 10% of their allocation of the SDL,&#x201d; says Rayne, &#x201c;while 20% funds the mandatory grant given to companies who submit their Workplace Skills Plans, Annual Training Reports and Pivotal Training Plans. The remaining 50% goes into the SETA&#x2019;s Discretionary Fund which provides companies with the opportunity to apply for and receive funding towards the implementation of special training projects and Pivotal Training programmes, such as learnerships.&#x201d; A learnership is a viable alternative to more costly and arduous training interventions. It can be an ideal training solution for corporate organisations and SMEs alike. A learnership is a work-based, SETA-approved learning programme directly related to an occupation or field of work that leads to a NQF qualification. Businesses can enter into learnership agreements with their current employers or with unemployed people. According to Rayne, learnerships help companies to improve B-BBEE scores; claim back on skills development spend; benefit from tax rebates; grow talent in line with business strategy; and prepare unemployed people for potential recruitment. Learnerships are typically implemented over a 12 month period with the learners attending an average of three days of training each month in addition to completing their assessments.
