Toyota Value Service (TVS) offers customers a guaranteed minimum of 10% discount on replacement parts - including engine coolant, brake fluid, differential oil and gearbox oil - as well as a capped labour rate when taking their cars in for servicing. This affords customers the opportunity to maintain a full Toyota service history and keep their car genuine, safe and reliable. The company is aiming to make the cost of vehicle ownership less onerous in tough economic times. All workmanship and parts carry a 12-month warranty while TVS is done in accordance with the prescribed service schedules - including inspection of safety critical items, as well as all routine adjustment and lubrication. With the help of an online service calculator, which is both vehicle and dealer specific, customers have full information of the items due at the next service, as well the costs. The calculator only requires the vehicle's registration or VIN number.
