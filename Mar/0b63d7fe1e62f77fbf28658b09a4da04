Allan Swart 123RF.com Called the Wangiri scam (in Japanese, wan means &#x201c;one&#x201d; and giri means &#x201c;cut&#x201d; or &#x201c;hang up&#x201d; depending on the source), it entails your phone ringing just once from an international number, usually in the middle of the night, so you don&#x2019;t notice it and wake up to a missed call. The missed call itself isn&#x2019;t the problem, it&#x2019;s what you do with it that is: When you call back, you either trigger an avalanche of spam being sent to you, or you get put on hold or put through to a premium number that charges exorbitant rates, so your airtime is instantly chewed up. The coldest cold call It&#x2019;s like the worst kind of marketing cold call &#x2013; but you&#x2019;re not even wasting your time talking about details you&#x2019;re not interested in. You&#x2019;re charged for being a decent human being who is concerned that you&#x2019;ve missed some important information. Apparently it arises from a computer dialling a large number of mobile phone numbers at random. While it&#x2019;s making the rounds at the moment, MyBroadband reports that SA was hit with a round of WhatsApp Wangiri calls back in 2015, where you&#x2019;d receive a contact attachment with a text asking that you &#x2018;call me back&#x2019;. The big networks like MTN advise that you rather be cautious in this regard &#x2013; if it&#x2019;s an overseas number you don&#x2019;t know and they really want to speak to you, they&#x2019;ll leave a message or call back. Here&#x2019;s a list of international numbers that were identified as Wangiri scam originators back in 2016.
