The video depicts how Chuene has successfully managed to create sought-after fashion items, by looking at the &#x2018;China bag&#x2019; from a new perspective, through recycling, reimagining and personifying its application. Using the iconic African plastic zipper bags, with its signature blue or black, white and red stripes, his Vernac designs feature bags in various forms (backpack, tote, sling, saddle, laptop and clutch) as well as wallets. Chuene was born in Limpopo and raised in Johannesburg. He established the Vernac label in 2011, after graduating in fashion design from LISOF Fashion Design School & Retail Education Institute. A new perspective on design &#x201c;The video presents the concept of perspective, by showing how looking at things in a new light can serve as a vehicle to augment reality. In this instance, it demonstrates a new perspective on design,&#x201d; says Jeremy Thompson, Scottish Leader&#x2019;s SA marketing manager. &#x201c;Chuene&#x2019;s positive and creative outlook is a great example of what Scottish Leader stands for as a brand: the richer possibilities brought on by exploring new perspectives and investigating new possibilities. It&#x2019;s about seeing the potential others can&#x2019;t and making a difference.&#x201d; As Chuene states in the video, &#x201c;But you know what? Things are starting to change and more people are moving forward. I do not think most people would think these bags would ever bring the word &#x2018;success&#x2019; to mind. If I told somebody 20 years ago that these bags could be a fashion statement, they would have laughed in my face. However, I suppose that is the trick to life. You have to try to see things or people, not for where they are right now but where they might be. You have to try to look at things from a different perspective. You have to try to see the potential. Because once you can do that, man, there&#x2019;s no stopping you.&#x201d; &#x201c;Where I grew up, we called it the mshana bag. However, across the continent of Africa, the bag has many names: the China bag, mme se keile, Ghana-must-go, khumbul'ekhaya. Each of those names has a story behind it, but each story has one thing in common. They are all stories about a struggle for a better life. Because this bag, much like most people living on this continent, hasn&#x2019;t had things easy,&#x201d; concludes Chuene. The video was produced by digital agency Mirum, with director Rod McCall at the helm.
