Beachfront villas A cluster of wonders Today, the panoramic paradise is one of the top tourist attractions in the Indian Ocean, with each attraction cementing a different chapter in Zanzibar&#x2019;s multi-cultural past and assorted ownership. Visitors can walk through the sultan&#x2019;s palace, the ruler over Zanzibar and much of Africa&#x2019;s Eastern Coast. Labelled one of the World&#x2019;s Heritage Sites in the year 2000, Stone Town is home to the House of Wonders, so called because it is said to be the first building in Zanzibar with electricity, emanating dancing lights from a distance at night.
