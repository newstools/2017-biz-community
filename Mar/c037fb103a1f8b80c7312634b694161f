Convention visitors can get tattooed at the event, view live tattooing, as well as experience an expo of clothing, art work, books and other merchandise related to the industry. Growing art form Romy van Tonder, founding organiser of the event, says that she has seen the art form grow in popularity over the last five years. &#x201c;The world has evolved and so has tattooing. We are part of a generation of liberation and as a result people have shown more confidence in being unique in expressing themselves. It is a culture that has diverse roots and as a result still today creates a place where all are welcome, as long as they respect the work we do and take it seriously,&#x201d; says Van Tonder.
