Passenger car sales through the dealer channel slumped 5% &#x2013; a shortfall that could not be counteracted by a growth of 26% for passenger cars through the rental channel. Total sales through the rental channel grew 32.5%, year-on-year. Sales through the government channel also contributed to this month&#x2019;s result &#x2013; with buying activity in light- medium- and heavy commercial vehicle segments contributing to a growth of 33%. &#x201c;The growth in the rental channel and commercial vehicle segments is indicative of these businesses entering their replacement cycles, acquiring new assets to refresh their fleets,&#x201d; said Rudolf Mahoney, head of brand and communications at WesBank.
