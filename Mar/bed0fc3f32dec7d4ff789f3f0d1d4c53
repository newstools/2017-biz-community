The Top 500 Awards' finalists were drawn directly from the annual Top 500: South Africa's Best Managed Companies publication; now in its eighth edition, which ranks the top five companies across 100 different business sectors. By distilling those 100 sectors into a handful of broader categories, the Top 500 Awards presented to the nation companies that are truly &#x2018;Best in Class', in terms of what they do. Viewed collectively, they comprise the vanguard of the regional economy: employing over 800,000 people and contributing a total of R109bn towards economic growth every year. Ralf Fletcher, CEO of Topco Media, commended the Top 500 finalists on their global growth and ability to keep the economy robust, as well as on their commitment to South Africa (the private sector, as a whole, spends between R8 - R9bn a year on charitable causes or socioeconomic development): &#x201c;These giants of industry are investing back into the country that has been their bedrock - by creating jobs, supporting SME's, facilitating skills development, empowering their supply chains, and through direct Corporate Social Investment. Their success is really our success, as a nation&#x201d;. 2017 Top 500 Award Winners: Top 500 Resources AwardAnglo American South Africa LimitedTop 500 Basic Industries AwardEngen Petroleum LimitedTop 500 General Industrials AwardBidvest Group LimitedTop 500 Consumer Goods AwardMercedes Benz South AfricaTop 500 Best Managed Organisation in Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals AwardDiscovery Health Medical SchemeTop 500 Retail AwardWoolworths Holdings LimitedTop 500 Hospitality AwardFlight CentreTop 500 Media AwardNaspers LimitedTop 500 Business Support Services AwardAdcorp Holdings LimitedTop 500 Transport AwardBidvest Panalpina LogisticsTop 500 Financial Services AwardStandard Bank of South Africa LimitedTop 500 ICT AwardEOH Holdings LimitedTop 500 Best Managed Company AwardAnglo American South African Limited
