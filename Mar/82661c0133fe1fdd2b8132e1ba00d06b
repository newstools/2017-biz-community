Mastercard at Mobile World CongressCustomers can download Masterpass from the iOS or Android app store, register and load their credit, debit or cheque cards from any bank into the digital wallet. Payment card information &#x2013; including card details from Mastercard and other payment networks &#x2013; is only captured once, eliminating the hassle of repeatedly entering these details each time they want to pay their bill. To settle their DStv accounts, customers simply click on the link they receive from DStv via SMS, and select Masterpass as the payment option. They authorise the payment by entering their ATM PIN or One Time PIN, and their account is updated within a few minutes. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re pleased to work with MultiChoice South Africa to make bill payments simpler, faster and more convenient for DStv customers,&#x201d; says Mark Elliott, division president of Mastercard, South Africa. Another key benefit is that DStv customers, who missed payments and had their DStv service disconnected, can settle their accounts using Masterpass and get reconnected quickly. &#x201c;The collaboration helps us to give our customers simple, secure and pain-free payment options that make life easier for them,&#x201d; says Mark Rayner, CEO for MultiChoice South Africa. Customers can rest assured that their information is secured, as the Masterpass digital wallet uses multiple layers of security, ensuring the user&#x2019;s personal and payments details are protected.
