&#x201c;We are very proud of the all-new Navara. It not only builds on, and improves, the workhorse capabilities of its predecessor, but it introduces comfort features previously unheard of in the pick-up segment. The Navara is a crowning achievement for Nissan in its 80-year heritage of pick-up production,&#x201d; says Xavier Gobille, Director for Sales, Marketing and Aftersales at Nissan Group of Africa. Initially, the Navara range will consist of three double cab models, offering a choice of mid- or high-specification and a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic gearbox. All models will be powered by the new 140 kW YS23DDT twin-turbo diesel engine.
