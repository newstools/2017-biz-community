Breedezicht Estate Of course, there are other coastal towns situated at the mouth of a river where leisure travellers can escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life or where those weary of it all together can retire. However, what I found makes Breedezicht, and Witsand in general, so unique is the quiet and safety. Add to this the spectacular view of the river and the sea meeting, and Breedezicht&#x2019;s proximity to all the authentic small town spots, and you have the makings of a relaxing getaway that will leave you revitalised. Followed by an early start, mini road trip along the beautiful Garden Route between Cape Town and Witsand, we arrived at the gates of the estate and promptly found La Grange so that we could book into our house for the weekend. This homey abode boasted spacious rooms with fantastic views of the river; an open plan kitchen, lounge and dining room and then, the leisure crown jewel of any holiday home in South Africa, an inside &#x201c;braai&#x201d; room with easy chairs, a dining table made for entertaining, and a deck with a view to die for. Breedezicht Estate Before La Grange left us to our vices, we got the low down on to-do&#x2019;s in and around Breedezicht with a light-hearted warning to not swim too freely in the river&#x2026; because there were sharks. He swore no one has ever been attacked, but we were resolved to stick to the white sandy beach instead. Although Witsand is considered the Whale Nursery of South Africa we, unfortunately, did not get to witness any of these gentle giants breach the waters &#x2013; but there&#x2019;s plenty other activities to keep you busy in this small town. We took a short stroll to the Pili Pili restaurant and bar at Breede River Lodge to stop by for a drink &#x2013; this is where you can fix your milkshake craving should you ever be in Witsand. We also took a walk along the river, as Breedezicht runs, to see what the other houses looked like &#x2013; some impressive mansions that blend with their surroundings, some traditional beach houses that are postcard worthy. A swimmer's paradise, a fisherman's haven The river seems to be the mainstay when it comes to attracting visitors to Witsand. From the deck we watched dozens of boats criss-cross the river in search of the next big fish. When the tide is low, an embankment is revealed from where fishermen fish, kite surfers take off, and many enjoy a swim. Visitors can also canoe or - if catapulting your own water transport is not your thing - enjoy a river boat cruise up to the &#x201c;Bush Pub&#x201d;. Witsand&#x2019;s beach is a wonder &#x2013; undisturbed does not cover it - it is pristine, clean and beautiful. The water is an inviting temperature, you&#x2019;ll get no freeze burn like you get on the West Coast and can swim at leisure with little traffic. It&#x2019;s no surprise that Witsand is known as a prime location for water sports and activities including surfing, wind surfing, deep sea fishing, and snorkeling. The swimming beach is also the location of one of Witsand&#x2019;s few restaurants, The Anchorage Beach Restaurant & Bar, where travellers can enjoy some good food and drinks while looking at the surf and the beach goers as the tides rise and fall. After we were sufficiently tanned &#x2013; or burned &#x2013; from a nap on the beach and our eyes burning from the salty water, we made our way back to Breedezicht where we stoked the fire for a braai and watched the sun set over the banks, beaches, hills and the houses that dot them.
