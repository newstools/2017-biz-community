Honeykome was presented with an &#x2018;innovative use of media&#x2019; bronze pixel for online sports betting site Sportingbet&#x2019;s I Bet You Don't Skip at the Bookmark Awards. That&#x2019;s why the team sent through this thumbs up emoji to show how they&#x2019;re currently feeling. &#x201c;Every year the calibre of work gets set a little higher this year was no different with fantastic examples of work from a wide variety of brands, agencies and publishers. We shone in the category of innovative use of media, winning a bronze,&#x201d; say Laws and Slow, with credit for the work also going to their video editing team and their performance media buying team.
