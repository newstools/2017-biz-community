Wisty Raleigh Interiors, Redesign Interiors, Even Flow Resources and Mi Africa will be participating in this environmentally responsible feature, sponsored by Canvex, a product of Expand a Sign. Dedicated to environmental sustainability as well as the social upliftment of local communities, Expand a Sign has partnered with Uzwelo in support of the Uzwelo Bags. Each bag &#x2013; made with waste material &#x2013; is uniquely crafted by KwaZulu-Natal women living in impoverished areas. The proceeds then go back into the community, feeding and educating the families of these talented individuals. &#x201c;We want to bring this element of social responsibility through environmental sustainability into the designs of the D cor District,&#x201d; explained Kirsty Fonzari, Canvex Marketing Manager. &#x201c;Each designer is encouraged to use locally sourced products, one of which is our locally woven Canvex wall canvas. This same wall canvas will then be recycled into Uzwelo Bags following the show, once again giving back to the community.&#x201d; Commenting on their involvement with Decorex Durban, Fonzari said the province&#x2019;s premier d cor, design and lifestyle exhibition was the perfect platform to showcase Canvex customised wall canvas and its ease of use. &#x201c;We are excited to take this opportunity to interact directly with top interior designers and architects in the industry,&#x201d; she said. Drawing inspiration from the rejuvenating trends of 2017, with a nod towards the Decorex &#x2018;Make your space your living dream&#x2019; theme, designers have been given creative space to unearth their inner vision in whichever room they select. Berea-based Wisty Raleigh of Wisty Raleigh Interiors will be combining her philosophy of comfort with style to the environmentally-conscious theme. Her lounge setting installation favours a &#x2018;classic contemporary look with a touch of the unexpected&#x2019;. &#x201c;Holding hands with the environment when designing a room is a conscious decision to choose locally-designed and manufactured furniture, as well as layering the natural materials of wood, metal, leather, rope and stone,&#x201d; explained Raleigh. &#x201c;The end result must still lead me to a serene, soothing space that invites relaxation and the nurturing of the self. Canvex has printed me a feature wall of limitless mountains to extend the sense of space and bring the environment to the fingertips.&#x201d; African-inspired d cor will encompass the bedroom setting created by Bulelwa Mvulana of Ballito-based interior design company, Mi Africa. &#x201c;Dreams are birthed in the bedroom and so we believe there is no better space to interpret the Decorex SA theme &#x2018;Make your space your living dream&#x2019; than in a bedroom setting,&#x201d; explained Mvulana. &#x201c;Local empowerment is key to our organisation, so all our products are locally designed and produced. The design focus will be ethnic patterns and geometrics.&#x201d; The &#x2018;urban jungle&#x2019; trend has resonated with designer, Paige Waplington of Redesign Interiors, whose eclectic style and passion for colour is set to explode at this year&#x2019;s D cor District. &#x201c;I am creating a space that appears to be a TV lounge but is not actually a TV lounge,&#x201d; said the Westville-based designer. &#x201c;It is more about the pieces within the setting. My space is inspired by our natural world and creates a tropical paradise to experience the #livingdream.&#x201d; In keeping with the locally crafted trend, all of Waplington&#x2019;s furniture is self-made with the d cor incorporating a variety of South African beadwork. &#x201c;Jungle interiors are fabulously on trend and pantones greenery too so expect gorgeous greens with luscious plants and tropical pinks,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;We are also launching an exciting wallpaper and furniture range which will be incorporated into the show and is a must-see for visitors!&#x201d; Sustainability and organic living underscore every design by Essenwood-based organisation, Even Flow D cor for the D cor District, designer, Brett Harris, has selected an &#x2018;olde world Karoo trading store&#x2019; installation. &#x201c;Think wooden flooring, wrought iron gates, desert vistas, antique maps, and cabinets filled with an assortment of vintage curiosities,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;This will form the backdrop to show off our organic, sustainable range of wooden d cor and tanned skins. Given the natural products we offer and our ethos of responsible sourcing, we aim to highlight the warm, authentic, rustic aesthetic of nature&#x2019;s design. Surrounding yourself with the unique beauty of organic products has a very grounding and calming effect.&#x201d; The feature will include quality, natural products with a unique twist such as Meranti folding chill chairs, Angora mohair rugs, Glow Horn table lamps, rustic towel racks, Kudu horn flame sculptures and artwork by local photographers.
