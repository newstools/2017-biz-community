This is the first-to-market AR experience for a US spirits brand, enticing users to Shazam to gather discounts on their Sauza or Hornitos purchases. Across the US and starting in April 2017, users who visually Shazam in-store creative will have the chance to play a fun, co-branded AR interactive memory game and, upon guessing, will receive redemptions to encourage purchase and top-of-mind presence. &#x201c;We are excited to collaborate with Shazam as the first company in the US to launch its augmented reality in-app functionality,&#x201d; said Michelle Cater, Beam Suntory&#x2019;s senior director of commercial marketing. &#x201c;With more than 150 years of experience producing premium tequila, we have constantly innovated throughout the years to reach consumers in new and exciting ways. This breakthrough technology offers an accessible, immersive platform with which to engage in a rewarded gamification experience at the point of purchase leading up to Cinco de Mayo. Sauza Tequila and Hornitos Premium Tequila should effectively break through the Cinco de Mayo advertising clutter, thanks to this exciting partnership.&#x201d; To access Shazam World:1. Open Shazam (ensure you have the latest Shazam iOS or Android version downloaded to your phone from the app store) 2. Tap the Camera on the Home Screen, and go through the quick on-boarding flow if this is your first time 3. Scan the Shazam Code on the card - keep your camera positioned over the card for magic! Bringing marketing to life Since launching visual-recognition functionality in 2015, Shazam has partnered with brands and artists to seamlessly connect its users to innovative custom content. AR marks the next huge step forward in this visual capability and offering. AR has become a cornerstone to engage users in immersive experiences and allow brands to reach audiences through a compelling, interactive new medium. The new platform can bring any marketing materials to life&#x2014;products, packaging, POS, advertising, events and more&#x2014;just by utilising the app to scan unique &#x2018;Shazam Codes&#x2019;. The codes are capable of delivering AR experiences including 3D animations, product visualisations, mini-games and 360-degree videos. &#x201c;We knew we were on to something big when we released visual image recognition in 2015,&#x201d; said Shazam CEO, Rich Riley. &#x201c;With the rapid rise of augmented reality, it is a natural evolution for Shazam to be a first-mover in delivering AR at scale.&#x201d; &#x201c;One of the things missing from augmented reality for advertisers has been a frictionless way to deliver these experiences at scale,&#x201d; said Shazam CRO, Greg Glenday. &#x201c;Because the company has such a massive install base and consumers are already accustomed to using the app for discovery&#x2014;we have now solved that problem. The possibilities for a brand to bring their products to life or make their advertising more engaging are only limited by the imagination.&#x201d; Shazam has partnered with Zappar, the augmented reality app on mobile devices, to deliver the code-scanning technology behind Shazam Codes as well as the platform&#x2019;s immersive and expressive short form mobile experiences. Shazam AR works with all iOS (Shazam v10.5) or Android (Shazam v7.5) devices. For more information, go to www.shazam.com.
