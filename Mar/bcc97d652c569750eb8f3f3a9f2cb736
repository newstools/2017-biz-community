The development is on 1.5ha, just over two rugby fields. Crystal Lagoons operates in more than 60 countries. "By bringing the beach to Pretoria, apartment living is taken to the next level by making resort lifestyle living a reality," Balwin boss Steve Brookes said. The development would have a gym, squash court, restaurant, concierge, laundromat, cinema room and a function room, as well as state of the art security. City Lagoons said: "In many cases, rainwater is all that is needed, thanks in part to a patented anti-evaporation film which restricts water loss." TMG Digital Source: Herald
