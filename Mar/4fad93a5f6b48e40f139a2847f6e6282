The widget utilises extensive research around how infants perceive colours and shapes in their first two years, and was created in partnership with a child psychologist. The result is an interface, which displays images onto the browsing page based on red, black and white graphic shapes, scientifically proven as the most appealing to babies&#x2019; brains. The effects of this kind of stimulation can support the development of visual ability, 90% of which appears during the first six months of a baby&#x2019;s life. To use, parents simply need to install the free &#x2018;Baby Browser&#x2019; widget, which then sits on their toolbar. When clicking on the extension, it instantly imports any text content, regardless of language or country, from the selected website while the special animation of the &#x2018;Baby Browser&#x2019; is overlaid. This allows parents to search for important information without sacrificing valuable time during the early stages of parenthood. The pace of the animation is related to the length of the article being read and is controllable by the parent. It is intended to be used in moderation, providing precious minutes of helpful browsing in a busy day. Piotr Osin&#x0301;ski & Patrycja Lukjanow, the creative team behind the project, said, &#x201c;In the very cluttered baby care market, communicating through new channels has become crucial. Rodzice.pl have proven that it understands its readers &#x2013; people for whom finding even five minutes to read useful information might be difficult &#x2013; and the readers&#x2019; babies too.
