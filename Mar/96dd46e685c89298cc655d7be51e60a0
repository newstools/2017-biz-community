Despite this, the research is positive for publishers and advertisers, with over 75% of South Africans citing that they&#x2019;ve never used or don&#x2019;t know what an ad blocker is and 18% stating that they will click on an ad if it seems interesting. &#x201c;Because the ad blocking numbers are relatively low compared to other countries, this gives South African publishers and advertisers a head-start to proactively tackle ad blocking,&#x201d; notes Greg Mason, Sub-Saharan Africa regional MD at Effective Measure. &#x201c;There are so many opportunities for our industry to keep these numbers from increasing. The data shows it&#x2019;s not that consumers don&#x2019;t like ads, it&#x2019;s the content and delivery that is directly affecting their decision to turn on ad blocking. &#x201c;It's an issue experienced worldwide and we already have solutions backed by data that we can adopt that will help ease the situation. It&#x2019;s time the advertising and publishing industry tackled this seriously.&#x201d; Read more about The state of ad-blocking in South Africa and view the full report here.
