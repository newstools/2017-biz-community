The big idea? We solved this universal agency problem using facial recognition technology in an exciting and unique way, becoming one of the first agencies in South Africa to champion the use of facial recognition to motivate their staff. The fridge identifies who is in front of it and then connects wirelessly to our timesheet system to verify that their timesheets are up-to-date. If they&#x2019;ve been completed, our platform unlocks the fridge and voila, the fridge dispenses an ice cold Windhoek beer! It&#x2019;s a win win all around, timesheets now get completed on time, and the experience is fun and rewarding!
