&#x201c;Redisa has helped to create jobs for myself and my team,&#x201d; says Haroun Gallie, a transporter based in the Western Cape. Gallie is one of REDISA&#x2019;s registered transporters and is part of an established and growing transporter network. These transporters are the cornerstone in the collection of waste tyres from micro collectors and dealers and are tasked with delivering them to the approved depots and processing plants. How it works Redisa-registered transporters receive an SMS detailing where to collect waste tyres from identified tyre dealers in the area. Transporters are then expected to deliver the waste tyres to the approved depot or recycling plant. Once the collection and delivery are complete, the transporter electronically confirms the mass of tyres loaded and delivered to the destination. Redisa director, Stacey Davidson says, &#x201c;Through the network created, millions of waste tyres have been transported to depots and recycling plants, all by empowering small business owners across the country. Our network relies on transporters to make sure waste tyres are collected efficiently, and that we have a lasting positive impact on the lives of many South Africans, not only through job creation but also by cleaning the environment of tyre waste. It is our hope that through the SMME development support we provide, it will equip entrepreneurial South Africans with the skills needed to empower others and further grow the logistics network.&#x201d; Criteria to apply to become a transporterBe over 18 years.
