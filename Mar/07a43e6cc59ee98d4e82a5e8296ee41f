Compared to the previous show, first impressions were of bigger fabric prints all back-lit, less natural wood finishes, more LED walls with a smidgen of corrugated iron and a couple of natural wood board and palette stands. Fairnet The single most noticeable element is large extremely large, seamless fabric prints with very colourful graphics. Another element is 3D shapes combined with excellent lighting. The majority of stands make use of rigged trussing, which is used to support elements of the stands. To make an impact with your stand, the designers face huge competition and with so many great looking stands, it is hard to pinpoint the most impressive So far, the one that has instantly blown me away is the Fairnet stand. Have a look and see for yourself. The clever use of transparent print overlaying an LED wall with an impressive glass cube juxtapositioned through the wall, the staircase display and the fish tank tables immediately drew our attention. The clever use of these tables as conversation points with enthusiastic staff and the little relaxation corner with attention to detail stand out. A textured floor with a little sand-filled circle around the base of the acrylic dome chairs that plays music of your choice just puts a smile on your face. It's our best so far! Will have to see if hall 5 has something to beat this... We will let you know! Click here to view a full gallery of Fairnet's work, our best so far.
