Working in collaboration with numerous donors, the SAME Foundation managed to build and fully equip four science labs, a computer lab, a library, as well as saw to the full refurbishment and upgrade of five classrooms and lavatories. The auditorium-style classrooms have been fitted with formica solid-core desktops, brand new equipment - including state of the art smartboard technology with CAPS aligned software, air-conditioning, new quality floors and ceilings, and a 24-hour security system. The total investment in this project amounted to over R4.5m. SAME Foundations chairman Trevor Pols says, &#x201c;The new science centre and computer lab will allow the learners at Manzomthombo to reach their full potential in both science and technology. This will open more tertiary and career options for the leaners. In the first year we have already noticed an increase of 8.9% in the matric pass rate.&#x201d; Quality healthcare and education The SAME Foundation is a national NPO that focuses on creating an environment where quality healthcare and education is available to everyone. This is done by renovating and equipping healthcare and education facilities around the country that are in dire need. &#x201c;This is the first of many such renovations to be completed around the Western Cape in partnership with the Department of Education and our loyal donors. We intend to replicate this model countrywide and are appealing to corporates to partner with us in changing the lives of the youth of our country through the provision of quality education.&#x201d; Some of the donors on this project included Engen, SGS, TMS Industrial Services, the Road Accident Fund, Grandslots, Zonke Monitoring Systems, Conco Group, Ilex South Africa, Bidvest Facilities Management, ADB Safegate, SAMD and others.
