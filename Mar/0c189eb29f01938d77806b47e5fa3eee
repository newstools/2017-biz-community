And, in order to achieve this, we will be using only the best range of South African furnishings and d cor, kindly sponsored by a number of exhibitors.&#x201d; 2017 trends explored Image credit: @home Contrasting the cold, hard metal and plastic that dominate our world in the form of electronics, the Tactility Trend will bring soothing textures into the home with the use of soft throws and fluffy stools. This textured sense continues into the Urban Jungle Trend whereby we reconnect with the natural world by bringing potted plants and wooden features into the home. This use of biomimicry &#x2013; mimicking the look and feel of nature &#x2013; can be seen in the various coffee tables used in the living room area. This unstructured look is carefully contrasted with the Linear Trend through the use of thin, black metal legs on selected furniture pieces. A strong sense of the #livingdream theme is felt in the Cosy Hovering Trend with the hanging of swing chairs on the patio, encouraging relaxation with a book. The feeling of suspension, as well as the, rocking motion create a space of comfort with the feeling of disconnection reminiscent of the electronic unplugging. And, in an attempt to free the mind, the Map Trend &#x2013; created through use of large, old-world maps &#x2013; prompts the imagination to wander into far-off lands while sparking memories of previous travel experiences. Image credit: @home Neutral pastels continue this sense of calm into the bedroom area with the popular Rose Gold Trend &#x2013; used in home and d cor accessories as well as cutlery &#x2013; perfectly suited to the Marble Trend that can be seen in crockery products. This is cleverly juxtaposed with the Black + White Trend in the bathroom whereby black taps and the black bath exterior clash dramatically with the interior white.
