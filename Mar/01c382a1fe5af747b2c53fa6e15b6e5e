An initial batch of 10 sourced and comprehensively restored examples of the iconic E-type are now on sale in the UK. E-type Reborn is a complete service from Jaguar Classic, which offers prospective customers the unique opportunity to purchase an original and highly collectable E-type direct from the vehicle&#x2019;s original manufacturer. The launch of E-type Reborn is a first for the company and extends the successful initiative previously introduced for Land Rover&#x2019;s Series I and Range Rover Classic models, which will also be on show at Essen. Each E-type Reborn is restored according to the company&#x2019;s original 1960s factory specification. Jaguar classic parts are used throughout, to maximise the vehicle&#x2019;s quality, longevity and collectability.
