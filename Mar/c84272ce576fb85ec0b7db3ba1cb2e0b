&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been an exhilarating past year working for Tractor Outdoor and I am thrilled to head up Mischief Media. It&#x2019;s an exciting time to work in the OOH industry as more clients are moving towards integrated innovative OOH campaigns,&#x201d; says Gisela. Over the past few months Mischief Media has successful executed compelling integrated innovative OOH campaigns for Jaguar, Land Rover and H&M, and have just been commissioned to execute the new M-Net Movies campaign. &#x201c;Our goal is to modernise the OOH innovation industry and to bring new ideas, technology and a fresh approach to the marketplace,&#x201d; says Simon Wall, Managing Director for Mischief Media.
