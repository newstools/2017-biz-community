It was great to see how the teams arrived at an insight and then brought it to life through a variety of engaging tactics including gamification, apps and celebrity influencers. Gary Scheiner&#x201c;I was pleased to see the breadth and depth of thinking these students applied to this brief. No two ideas were even remotely similar,&#x201d; added Scheiner. &#x201c;For me, the ideas that rose to the top were the ones where the teams applied strategic thinking and insights that drove their creative decisions. They presented rational arguments to make their case. The best ideas were original, highly creative, and on brief. I&#x2019;m optimistic about the future of healthcare marketing.&#x201d; Finalist teams will be interviewed by the Global Awards Young Globals sponsoring agencies to determine the 2016 Young Globals award-winner.
