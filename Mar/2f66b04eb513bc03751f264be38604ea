Thou shalt not post more than two photos or statuses a day Please do not dominate our feed with spam of every course of your Michelin-star dinner, every 360-degree angle of your selfie (no matter how &#x2018;on point&#x2019; your hair or brows are), or every change of opinion. HDI Youth Marketeers Thou shalt not stalk and mistakenly like a photo from 68 weeks ago We all do it. 20 clicks later and you are looking at Rocking the Daisies photos on your boyfriend&#x2019;s friend&#x2019;s sister-in-law&#x2019;s best friend&#x2019;s page. Just watch that finger pressure while you creep, because after a few swipes, your finger will &#x2018;like&#x2019;. Once you double tap, you cannot go back. Thou shalt not accept friend requests from extended family Nothing takes cred out of a cool pic faster than your aunt and mother sharing formalities in the comments section. &#x201c;Hello Debs, Sam looks just like you 30 years ago. Hope you, Joe and the kids are well LOL Sue.&#x201d; Thou shalt not over-filter or make-up-app thy selfies We know what you look like in real life. And we know what digital eyeshadow and &#x2018;Beauty Face&#x2019; airbrushing looks like. Keep it real and stick to one filter. Thou shalt not force &#x201c;your like could save a life&#x201d; on us We&#x2019;re not nearly as na ve as you think. We know that passively putting a thumbs-up on a picture of a drought won&#x2019;t create change. So, stop with the guilt trip and give us real opportunities to take action! Thou shalt not use #LoveLivesHere or #Blessed in every second post Yes, we get that you want to show us all how great your life (and love life) is. But please do it in moderation &#x2013; the pics, the posts, the hashtags&#x2026; Thou shalt not like thy own posts Not even to change your like count to an even number. It&#x2019;s pretty obvious you like it if you posted it. This doesn&#x2019;t even qualify to be wrong. It&#x2019;s sad in fact. It just looks lame when you pat your own back! Thou shalt not make a brand new relationship Facebook official There&#x2019;s no subtle way to change your relationship status on social media, and a breakup is much worse when everyone knows about it (including opportunists sliding into your DMs). Keep it private until you know this one&#x2019;s a keeper! Thou shalt not play Dr Phil to thou followers Your &#x2018;deep and meaningful&#x2019; Tibetan quotes and hustle phrases are more annoying than inspiring &#x2013; especially when they&#x2019;re the caption to your pouting selfie or your gym-mirror pic. And don&#x2019;t post scathing quotes after a fight or breakup &#x2013; it just makes you seem petty and desperate. Just don&#x2019;t. Thou shalt not share anything you wouldn&#x2019;t want your gran to see No nudity, no swearing, no venting. Not even on Snapchat. The screenshot is no one's best friend and it will probably come back to bite you. Also, auto-delete your tweets to avoid being dragged for a change of opinion.
