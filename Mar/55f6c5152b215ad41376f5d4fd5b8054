Majozi answers some quick questions on his brand ambassadorship: Tell us how you became the brand ambassador for Premier Hotels & Resorts I have the privilege of travelling around the country with my music and I thought it would be a good idea to partner with a well-established hotel brand. I checked out Premier Hotels, they looked really cool so I sent them a message. To my surprise and delight, they actually replied. What does it mean to you to be Premier&#x2019;s brand ambassador? For me, it&#x2019;s having the comfort of knowing that when I travel I have a wonderful place to stay with all the comforts and facilities I need to make a busy touring life way easier. What has your journey with Premier been like so far? It&#x2019;s been really awesome. I&#x2019;ve really appreciated and enjoyed the times I've stayed, and I love the gym there. What does your role as brand ambassador include? Sharing post of my visits and showing people how rad the hotels are. What can we look forward to during your stint as Premier&#x2019;s brand ambassador? You can look forward to some fun and practical videos of what&#x2019;s available and all the facilities that they have. How would you describe the Premier brand, what are they all about? African. Smart but still very homely. Awesome service with great facilities.
