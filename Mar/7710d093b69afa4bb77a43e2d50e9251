This new multi-format Cineplex will include the first Xtreme cinema for the province and introduces two VIP cinemas with recliner seating, a VIP lounge and bar, and an la carte menu prepared in its kitchen. It will also feature the next-generation Dolby Atmos sound system, making it the fourth such equipped cinema in South Africa. Dolby Atmos delivers 360-degree sound, including overhead speakers and a large array of speakers placed strategically throughout the cinema &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve entered a new era in movie-going, by improving the level and manner in which movies are viewed, along with the overall experience. We have led the way with multi-format cinema options at most of our Cineplexes nationwide. We&#x2019;re excited to introduce our Xtreme brand in KwaZulu-Natal, following its success in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town,&#x201d; says Nitesh Matai, Nu Metro&#x2019;s managing executive.
