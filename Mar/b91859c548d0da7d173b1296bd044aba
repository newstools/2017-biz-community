Egg and Arcade brand film campaigns have 24 nominations between them Sunu up for seven Bookmarks in Branded Content and Online Video &#x2013; Craft for One Source Kyle Lewis up for four Bookmarks in Branded Content and Online Video &#x2013; Craft </li></li> Native VML&#x2019;s One Source campaign for Absolut with Khuli Chana has a whopping 14 nominations &#x2013; the most of any campaign - at the 2017 Bookmarks, South Africa&#x2019;s premier digital awards. Egg Films&#x2019; Sunu directed the campaign&#x2019;s central music video and the short documentaries that supported it, which are up for seven Bookmarks in the Branded Content and Online Video &#x2013; Craft categories. Arcade Content&#x2019;s Kyle Lewis has Branded Content and Online Video &#x2013; Craft nominations for the music videos he directed with Kwesta and Dabone for Ogilvy Cape Town&#x2019;s #011Beats campaign for Volkswagen and with Cassper Nyovest for King James&#x2019; Conspicuous Saving campaign for Sanlam. Both campaigns have five nominations each. Overall, campaigns Egg and Arcade worked on are nominated for a combined 24 Bookmarks. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s exciting to see a music campaign emerge as the most nominated this year,&#x201d; says Colin Howard, Arcade and Egg Films&#x2019; managing director. &#x201c;All three of our nominated campaigns are music videos, which speaks to the medium&#x2019;s power. One Source was recently nominated for a Metro FM Award for Best Music Video, while Mr Madumane was up for Best Music Video at The SA Hip Hop Awards in December, so it&#x2019;s good to see we&#x2019;re finding the balance in making work that rewards both the clients&#x2019; investment and the fans&#x2019; time. Congrats to all three agencies &#x2013; Native VML, King James and Ogilvy Cape Town &#x2013; for thinking outside the box and embracing new mediums like this.&#x201d; For more information, visit https://arcadecontent.tv and https://eggfilms.tv.
