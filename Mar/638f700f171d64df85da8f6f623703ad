SPCA - Fluffy from Antonius Alexius on Vimeo.FoxP2 ECD Justin Gomes says, &#x201c;After spending time learning more about the organisation, what stood out for us about the SPCA is just how committed it is to finding a pet that matches your personality type and physical environment. This was the differentiator for us, so much so, that it informed the insight for the campaign. With the SPCA, you get to choose a family member that complements you. We then relied on award winning director Anton Visser to bring our vision to life and his light, comedic touch has provided all the nuance and charm needed to deliver our message in an emotionally resonant way.&#x201d; Watch the 'Buddy' and 'Muffy' versions here. The core idea for the adoption campaign centres around the warm, joyful experience of bringing a rescue animal into a family and the adverts convey this in a fun manner. Allan Perrins, CoGH SPCA CEO says, &#x201c;The adverts that have been created are amazing, unique, tongue-in-cheek and uplifting. Keep an eye out to catch our television and radio adverts broadcast across DStv, e.tv and national radio channels. If you're thinking about bringing an animal into your life, there really is no other choice than the adoption of an SPCA rescue pet.&#x201d;
