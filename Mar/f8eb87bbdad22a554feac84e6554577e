Authors&#x2019; Day forms part of the lineup of the inaugural Johannesburg Design Week 2017, an exciting new first-for-Gauteng initiative that aims to make great design accessible to people from all walks of life. Launching this year at the Rand Show, South Africa&#x2019;s biggest consumer exhibition, Johannesburg Design Week 2017 consists of curated displays of intriguing design, public workshops and talks on design topics, and a series of conferences, workshops and master classes that will inspire those in the world of business. And of course, Authors&#x2019; Day... Inspiration from top authors Join Deon Maas, Sam Cowen, Paula Gruben and Douglas Kruger on Thursday, 20 April, for this half-day event, where they&#x2019;ll discuss their latest books, give advice on writing a book, and guide aspiring authors on the often daunting process of getting published. There will also be book signings after the event. Deon Maas&#x2019;s Melk die Heilige Koeie (Tafelberg, 2016) takes on everything &#x201c;from beards and Banting to Zupta and zol&#x201d;, with the same honesty, controversy and humour that built him a reputation for being a columnist who tells it like it is. Currently working as a film producer, Deon is also the author of Witboy in Africa. Radio host and author Sam Cowen is the author of bestselling titles Waiting for Christopher and Good Enough Mother, two popular books on motherhood. Her latest book, From Whiskey to Water (Jacana, 2016), is described as a &#x201c;no-holds-barred memoir&#x201d; about her struggle with addiction. Maverick indie author Paula Gruben released Umbilicus: An autobiographical novel in 2016. It's a coming-of-age story based on her remarkable journey as an adoptee, going in search of and reuniting with her biological family. She will take Authors&#x2019; Day delegates behind the scenes of a #writerslife, offering first-hand insight and practical advice on what goes into writing, designing, producing, marketing, and distributing your first book. She will spill the beans on the pros and cons of the self-publishing industry, and she will share some innovative ideas on how to &#x2018;use your book as a business card&#x2019;, to grow your career as an &#x2018;authorpreneur&#x2019;. Douglas Kruger is a professional speaker and business author, who has penned six business books, including the acclaimed Own Your Industry &#x2013; How to Position Yourself as an Expert. His latest book, They&#x2019;re Your Rules &#x2013; Break Them! (Penguin Random House, 2016), looks at how behemoth organisations can become more agile. Find Douglas at www.douglaskruger.co.za.
