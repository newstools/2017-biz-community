Cassper Nyovest&#x2019;s Mr Madumane music video formed part of King James&#x2019; Conspicuous Saving Sanlam campaign, which also won Bronze for Integrated Multi-Platform Campaign. In the music video, Cassper&#x2019;s biting lyrics and Kyle&#x2019;s playful imagery combine to mock materialism and people who have to spend money to earn respect. Nominated as Best Music Video at the SA Hip Hop Awards in December, Mr Madumane was the centrepiece of a larger campaign, which challenged Cassper and model Pearl Thusi to live frugally for National Savings Month, to encourage their fans to embrace a future that is low on debt and high on savings. A world-first collaboration to find the sound of Jozi, the 011Beats music video featured Kwesta and Dabone creating the sound of the &#x2018;City of Gold&#x2019; - inside the new Volkswagen Polo Beats. Kwesta and Dabone spent one night in the new Volkswagen Polo Beats, driving around the city of Jozi, using geo-location tech to hunt for the city&#x2019;s diverse sounds. While their night was live-streamed, Kwesta wrote the lyrics, with some help from his social media fans, while Dabone proved the car&#x2019;s sound system is so good it can double as a recording studio. In addition to the Branded Content Bronze at the Bookmarks, the Ogilvy Cape Town campaign won Silvers for Integrated Multi-Platform Campaign and Innovative Use of Media, as well as Bronze for Mobile Campaign. Both campaigns had five nominations each going into the awards. See more of Kyle&#x2019;s brand films and music videos at https://arcadecontent.tv/south-african-director/kyle-lewis/.
