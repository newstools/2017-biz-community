Atang Tshikare X Mervyn Gers for GUILD Ben OrkinFor the launch collab-collection, distinctive artwork from Andile Buka, Andile Dyalvane, Atang Tshikare, Buki Akib, Conrad Botes, Dokter and Misses, Justine Mahoney, Laduma Ngxokolo, Lukhanyo Mdingi and Porky Hefer will transform into exclusive accessories, fashion and homeware and their own disruptive take on the &#x2018;I Love Cape Town&#x2019; T-shirt. Under the guidance of Tammy Tinker, The Guild Group&#x2019;s creative director, seasonal ranges will be developed with Cape Town manufacturers, utilising commissioned designs from selected visionary voices &#x2013; from fine art to fashion and furniture design &#x2013; to create limited-edition product ranges. Tinker says of the Concept product, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve identified brands that have beautiful design as their ethos and have worked together to develop collaborative items unique to Guild. Hope on Hopkins Gin will work with Skoon Skincare to produce a face cream in its miniature bottles, while Laurie Wiid van Heerden has collaborated with Ceramic Matters to create beautiful, quirky paintbrush paperweights.&#x201d; Curating a wide assortment of items from the most interesting artisans in Africa, that will be mainly exclusive to the store, Concept will be an ever-evolving emporium captivating locals and visitors and providing fashion, jewellery, accessories, stationery, books, gifting, ceramics, tech and kids&#x2019; products. In the tradition of the most exciting museum and gallery stores around the world, Concept aims to ensure that nobody leaves Guild empty-handed. Guild Studio will stand alongside Concept, selling production furniture by South African designers, leading with an in-house range designed by The Guild Group CCO, Julian McGowan. Presenting the most important names in local contemporary furniture, including Gregor Jenkin, Meyer von Wielligh and Dokter and Misses, Guild Studio offers ranges that are relevant, original and an antidote to imported and mass-produced furniture. Southern Guild&#x2019;s inaugural show at the new site will celebrate the work of the gallery&#x2019;s design heroes including Adam Birch, Andile Dyalvane, Atang Tshikare, Charles Haupt, Cheick Diallo, Conrad Hicks, David Krynauw, Dokter and Misses, Gregor Jenkin, Hamed Ouattara, John Vogel, Justine Mahoney, Laurie Wiid van Heerden, Meyer von Wielligh, Otto du Plessis, Paco Pakdoust, Porky Hefer and Xandre Kriel.
