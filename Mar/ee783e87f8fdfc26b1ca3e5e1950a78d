It is situated on the corner of Riebeeck and Long Street in Cape Town&#x2019;s foreshore. The Radisson Blu Hotel & Residence&#x2019;s design is a beautiful mix of historic and ultra-modern. The 214-room hotel residence is within walking distance of all the city&#x2019;s main tourist attractions and just a kilometer away from the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC). Desmond O'Connor, general manager of the Radisson Blu Hotel & Residence Cape Town, says: &#x201c;The iconic design of the building pays homage to the Art Deco design language and the same design direction has been applied in the public areas and, to an extent, in the bedrooms. In conjunction with this style, inspiration was also drawn from the natural elements of the city. The design and d cor of the rooms thus create a cocoon and instils a welcoming calm to the traveller, something that is not commonly found in city hotels these days. It creates a sense of serenity.&#x201d; Marc Descrozaille of the Rezidor Hotel Group and Desmond O'Connor of the Radisson Blu Hotel & Residence Cape Town Hotel set to take advantage of increasing business travel The hotel also is set to take advantage of the influx of corporate travellers, as Cape Town fast cements its place as one of the world&#x2019;s leading conference and exhibition capitals.
