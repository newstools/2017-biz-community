jackmac34 via pixabayThe February combine harvester sales of 19 units were three units down on the 22 units sold in February last year. Combine harvester sales for the year-to-date are approximately 8% down on last year. The current lower levels of sales reflect a high degree of caution in the market. The current market situation is such that farmers can hold back for a while on their buying decisions. The stronger rand means that equipment prices have stabilised and good rains in most areas mean that the majority of farmers will harvest significantly better crops than last year. However, the excellent summer crop expectations have, of course, depressed crop prices. The industry expects short-term sales to continue at the current lower levels, improving later when farmers start harvesting. Expectations for 2017 are that overall tractor sales should be at least as good as those in 2016. &#x2013; SAAMA
