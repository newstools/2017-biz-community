Robert Lischka via Pixabay The INMA Global Media Awards competition received 655 entries from 196 media companies in 36 countries. Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media and radio media. Competition entries were judged in February by an international panel of 44 executives from 17 countries. Judges represented a wide range of media-related companies. This year&#x2019;s Global Media Awards competition focused on six activities crucial to success:&#x2022; Energizing brands &#x2022; Creating new products &#x2022; Growing, engaging and monetising audiences &#x2022; Growing advertising revenue &#x2022; Developing customer insights &#x2022; Instilling innovation&#x201c;Across the media community internationally, creativity abounds,&#x201d; said Earl J. Wilkinson, executive director and CEO of INMA. &#x201c;Notable this year was the diversity of media companies, including television and digital, along with strong performances from the South Pacific and Scandinavia. The news media industry gets smarter as that diversity expands.&#x201d; Finalists Finalists below are listed alphabetically. Group 1 represents regional/local brands.
