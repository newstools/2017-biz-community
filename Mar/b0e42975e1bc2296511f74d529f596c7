Wine lovers can revel in the opportunity to be amongst the first to taste the young, unfiltered wines from the 2017 harvest straight from the barrel and tanks. Participating wineries range from small boutique cellars to family-owned vineyards and iconic producers. Each has a unique atmosphere, but will be pulling out all the stops to present a fun-filled day programme with superlative young wines, amusing harvest activities as well as great kids&#x2019; entertainment. Visitors can also enjoy live music, fabulous food offerings and the incredibly beautiful scenery of the Boland. If you&#x2019;re feeling energetic, enter Run The Vines (www.runthevines.co.za) at Caleis in aid of Drakenstein Fire Fighting Group. Your entry includes your OmmiBerg ticket. View the complete programme on www.ommiberg.co.za. Tickets cost R120.00 from www.webtickets.co.za and will also be available at the gates of participating wineries at R150.00 on Saturday.
