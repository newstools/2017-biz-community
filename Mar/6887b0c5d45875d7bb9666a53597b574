This freedom is the cornerstone of comedians&#x2019; ability to make people laugh &#x2013; and to make a living. This is the freedom they have (and need) to create, to express and to poke fun at the serious and often silly side of everyday life. &#x201c;This theme was chosen after the success of last year&#x2019;s theme &#x2013; &#x2018;For The Love Of Laughter&#x2019;. We saw a really good reception by the South African public to a more accessible, upbeat theme. Not to say we won&#x2019;t take a darker turn down the road again, but for now, while the country navigates a tough period - we felt it would be great to celebrate positive aspects of comedy again,&#x201d; says John Vlismas, Savanna CCA co-founder. With its expansion into Africa, the style of the Savanna CCA&#x2019;s this year will be an elegant mix of Afro-chic and Great Gatsby glam, which will be carried through from the event artwork to the main awards show itself. 2017 categories The Savanna CCA&#x2019;s has expanded to 11 awards (the largest to date), and recognise outstanding talent across a range of categories: The Savanna Newcomer Comic Award.
