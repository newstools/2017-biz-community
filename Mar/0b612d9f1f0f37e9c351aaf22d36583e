Many hours of on-air training with handpicked individuals has resulted in three new presenters making their debut at the station from the beginning of April. Alucius Mocumi will be on air from 01h00 to 05h00 weekdays and 16h00 to 19h00 on Sunday, Thabang Moselani will keep listeners company from 22h00 to 01h00 Monday to Thursday and from 22h00 to 01h00 on Sundays, with Chantell Leach taking the 00h00 to 03h00 shift on weekends. OFM is also happy to welcome Christina Kouveldt, who will be joining the OFM Breakfast team, and Shandor Potgieter, who will be hosting the Saturday mid-morning show from 09h00 to 13h00. Furthermore, OFM is reintroducing a previously successful split radio show from Monday to Friday from 09h00 to 13h00. Lerato Lelia will move into daytime radio, by presenting the mid-morning show to the southern Free State and Northern Cape, while Isabel Potgieter will continue to present her programme live from Klerksdorp to the northern Free State, Vaal and North West province. With the introduction of new voices, OFM&#x2019;s on-air offering will also get a bit of a face-lift with a firm focus on music. Says Nick Efstathiou, OFM&#x2019;s General Manager: &#x201c;Our listeners love music and so do we! By welcoming some new talent to the station and changing our presenter line-up slightly, we feel that it is also appropriate to take a fresh look at our music offering and make sure that we keep playing the songs our listeners love.&#x201d; Other interesting and exciting projects include a number of on-air competitions later in the year, including Zero Balance and the Sound of Your Life. Those who&#x2019;ve always had aspirations to be on air might also get their chance this year. Celeb Radio will also return in June with confirmed guests Janina Oberholzer and Nianell. &#x201c;We are excited about these new elements and we hope our listeners are too. With these changes, we hope to engage, inform and entertain our loyal listeners even more,&#x201d; says Efstathiou.
