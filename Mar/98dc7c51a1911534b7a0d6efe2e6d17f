Launched in Nigeria last year, the ScholarX app allows users to select parameters and scroll through lists of available scholarships that match their requirements. Scholarships are available for undergraduate, masters and PhD students. Almost 10,000 students have used the platform so far, accessing over 10,000 scholarships as well as expert advice on the application process. The startup is now starting to expand, beginning with Ghana, where AB Review will help with curating local scholarships, building awareness and engineering potential partnerships with various stakeholders &#x201c;We are elated to announce our partnership with AB Review,&#x201d; said Bola Lawal, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of ScholarX. &#x201c;We believe this integration is a perfect fit as we can leverage on the great reputation AB Review has built in Ghana over the years through its brands and to further help African youths access local and foreign based higher education funding opportunities.&#x201d; The timeline for full implementation of the partnership is one month. &#x201c;ScholarX has come at an opportune time to aid students. Ghanaian students can now access this useful app and all its benefits through this timely partnership,&#x201d; said Abel Ohene Acquaye, AB Review&#x2019;s executive director.
