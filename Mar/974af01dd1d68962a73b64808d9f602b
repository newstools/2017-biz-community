READ Trainer, Mavis Maseko 2016 Word Warrior winner, Jessie McAvoyThe Word Warrior 2016 Competition was launched as part of READ&#x2019;s annual Readathon Campaign, which aims to encourage reading and writing among South African youth. Aimed at learners from the ages of nine through 16, the competition required entrants to write about absolutely anything that tickled their fancy. A wonderful cross-section of genres was among the entries: fiction, action, horror, fantasy and more. Several entrants were wordsmiths of note, and entries were of a particularly high standard. McAvoy caught the judging panel&#x2019;s collective eye with her story entitled &#x2018;A Detective&#x2019;s Life&#x2019;. The level of creativity employed showed tremendous talent. Every line made you want to go on to read the next, and a fine thread of sharp wit was woven in this quirky detective&#x2019;s mission.
