Says David Germain, Seychelles Tourism Board, director for Africa and the Americas: &#x201c;We are extremely pleased about the latest figures from the South African market and we are looking forward to, in partnership with South African travellers and our trade partners, to grow at an even greater pace in the coming year.&#x201d; Germain adds that the launch of Air Seychelles&#x2019; year-round flights from Durban to the Seychelles, on 30 March, will play a definitive role in opening up the destination to even more South Africans. The new service to Durban is in addition to Air Seychelles&#x2019; five flights a week from Johannesburg. Also commenting on the latest figures, the deputy chief executive of the Seychelles Tourism Board (STB), Jennifer Sinon said: &#x201c;We are now reaping the rewards of all the activities and strategies of last year as the benefits trickle down in the months and years to come. We acknowledge that this year is going to be challenging both locally and internationally but we are optimistic that the destination will remain resilient.&#x201d;
