In my history at BDO in Durban, we haven&#x2019;t previously had anyone appointed to the Honours Roll so Kelton Bingham&#x2019;s achievement is outstanding.&#x201d; SAICA appoint candidates to the Honours Roll who perform exceptionally well and show the greatest insight into the way they complete the APC case study tasks. &#x201c;APC is the last examination in the long journey to qualifying as a registered Chartered Accountant,&#x201d; continues Juckes. &#x201c;Once trainees have completed their remaining eight months of training (a three-year period in total), they will apply to be registered as a Chartered Accountant and begin their careers as professionals in the wonderful career of accountancy.&#x201d;
