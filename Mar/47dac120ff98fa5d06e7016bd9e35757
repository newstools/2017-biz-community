Pole-and-line, also known as &#x2018;one-by-one&#x2019;, is a highly selective and traditional way to catch tuna. A particular hook size is used to ensure that the undersized immature fish, which have not yet had a chance to breed, cannot be caught. This catch method also virtually eliminates the by-catch of other species, such as sharks, sea turtles and dolphins. Through this Maldivian source of tuna, Woolworths&#x2019; customers will be supporting an important fishing community, which acts as custodians of the ocean environment that their livelihood depends on. The retailer&#x2019;s Fishing for the Future initiative is an on-going drive to meet various sustainability goals for the wild-caught and farmed seafood it sells. Currently there is no commercially available skipjack tuna in South African waters and there are not sufficient amounts of other tuna species for commercial canning. Consequently, there is no local tuna canning facility to source from. The MSC is a global non-profit body which works to address unsustainable fishing and helps to safeguard seafood stocks for future generations. MSC certification is an assurance of sustainable and transparent fishing practices and ensures traceability from fishing boat to store. &#x201c;Woolworths is taking its customers on an important stage of its Fishing for the Future journey,&#x201d; comments Martin Purves, MD of the International Pole & Line Foundation (IPNLF). &#x201c;Supporting small, one-by-one fisheries is the sustainable way to secure high quality, responsible and ethically caught tuna. It is fantastic to see one of South Africa&#x2019;s leading retailers making such a commitment to this sustainable tuna fishing practice.&#x201d; Customer competition To celebrate the MSC certified canned tuna milestone, customers have the opportunity to win an 8 day/7 night luxury holiday for two in the Maldives valued at R150,000.
