The festive theme is strong in March, with the Cape Town Carnival 2017 bringing the streets to life with vibrant colours and sounds, a real multi-cultural celebration in the Mother City. International visitors love the wide range of musical styles represented here, and it&#x2019;s one of the best ways to showcase what&#x2019;s on offer. It&#x2019;s also a means of building a career for local musicians, for whom the tourism rand goes a long way to providing them with the resources they need for support, studio time and promotion. Cape Town Tourism Chairperson Enver Mally says: &#x201c;Every day feels like a festival here in the city, but these events bring us all together with the common goal of celebrating what we have. They also provide welcomed revenue and employment for many &#x2013; what better way to improve the lives of our fellow Capetonians than by having a party? On a more serious note, tourism benefits from these initiatives, and the visitors themselves will enjoy a slice of Cape Town life when attending. Well done to the organisers for ensuring that these events grow in stature from year to year. If we could do a few of these every month, seasonality would no longer be a challenge faced by the tourism sector. Already we have many cheese and wine festivals, family fun days, market days and music concerts, so perhaps the next big event idea is just waiting to be executed.&#x201d; The Cape Town Carnival takes place on 18 March 2017 at the Green Point Fan Walk. The Cape Town International Jazz Festival takes place from 31 March &#x2013; 01 April 2017 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre.
