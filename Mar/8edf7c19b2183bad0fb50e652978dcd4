The new facility is expected to become operational in the second quarter of 2017. &#x201c;This investment in our new and more efficient 60,000 m (645,000 square feet) facility demonstrates our commitment to Caterpillar customers in Africa. We are positioned to deliver the best solution to satisfy customer service needs now and far into the future. It is a win-win for our customers, our dealers in the region and Caterpillar. Caterpillar and our dealers know that getting replacement parts to our customers, such as a new filter or undercarriage, as quickly as possible is extremely important to reduce idle time and save money,&#x201d; said Bonnie Fetch, Cat parts distribution director. The consolidation is part of the previously announced plan of the company, its independent dealers, and the Caterpillar Foundation to invest more than US$1 billion in countries throughout Africa over five years.
