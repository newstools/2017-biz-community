The A330-200 has 222 seats, 88 more than the smaller aircraft it has replaced. Inbound flights are already heavily booked till 12 March and demand is growing daily, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe. &#x201c;March 2017 heralds a new dawn for tourism, with the arrival of SAA&#x2019;s A330-200 in Victoria Falls,&#x201d; says Kennedy. &#x201c;This is the beginning of an exciting and positive period for tourism in the region.&#x201d; In addition, Ethiopian Airlines will begin four flights weekly from 26 March from Addis Ababa to Victoria Falls, using the latest Boeing 737. Kenya Airways will begin direct flights three times a week from Nairobi to Victoria Falls on 18 May. &#x201c;These three airlines alone add 80,000 new seats per annum into Victoria Falls International Airport and the region, offering a huge opportunity for growth, as well as connecting new destinations with the incredible Victoria Falls hub and KAZA tourism region,&#x201d; Kennedy says. Victoria Falls is in the middle of Southern Africa&#x2019;s Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA), which boasts pristine and diverse wildlife areas.
