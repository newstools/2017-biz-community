 Jozsef Szasz-Fabian 123RF.comHigh levels of geosmin are currently being experienced in the water drawn from the Theewaterskloof Dam. Geosmin is a naturally occurring organic compound which has an earthy flavour and aroma and which is sometimes present in water. In an attempt to deal with geosmin, the city is currently increasing powdered activated carbon dosing during the water treatment process. It may take some time for the taste and smell of the water to normalise over a large area of the central and southern suburbs of Cape Town. No threat to human health "It must be emphasised that geosmin poses no threat to human health. Even minute concentrations can be detected by the incredibly sensitive human palate. "We also warn residents against falling victim to the many water-related hoaxes that are out there and which are causing unnecessary panic. Those driving these hoaxes clearly have nothing better to do with their time. "One hoax, which is being repeated every so often, warns that water will be cut off across the whole metro on specified dates. Such blanket cut-offs are not done. Residents must not fall for this type of panic-mongering. "Customers should note that water pressure may be reduced to limit water leaks and that slight changes in water taste and clarity may occur due to low dam levels, but this does not affect quality," said the city&#x2019;s mayoral committee member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services and Energy, councillor Xanthea Limberg. Residents can contact the city via email to az.vog.nwotepac&#64;snoitcirtser.retaw for queries or to report contraventions (evidence should be provided to assist the city&#x2019;s enforcement efforts) or they can send an SMS to 31373.
