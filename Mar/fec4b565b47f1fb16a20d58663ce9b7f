EuroShop 2017 is set to be one of the biggest in the event's history with 2,400 exhibitors from 61 countries set to participate. Digitalisation in retail will be one of the main themes at this year's event and Scan Display MD Justin Hawes has already spoken on the international platform about their experiences with event greening. He spoke at yesterday's Expo and Event Forum on event greening and what he has learnt while implementing event greening at various events. He included case studies such as the South African Climate Change Response Expo hosted at COP17 in 2011, which was awarded the UFI Sustainable Development Award in 2013, and Africa&#x2019;s leading MICE event, Meetings Africa, which has won multiple green awards. Hawes believes that you cannot simply &#x201c;talk the talk&#x201d; but must also &#x201c;walk the walk&#x201d;, so all of his knowledge is shaped by personal experience and real events.
