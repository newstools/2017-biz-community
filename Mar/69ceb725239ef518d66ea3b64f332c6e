Boston Media House TK Mhlongo explaining the various study options available to the learners &#x201c;Our intention with the Careers Expo is to build a film and television industry filled with dynamic young individuals who will contribute to the growth of our economy. This can only be done through education and skills development. The expo is a chance for learners and teachers to interact and engage on the many career opportunities within the film and television industry and our partnerships with national and regional tertiary institutions, who are exhibiting, is a crucial part of the program. says M-Net CEO Yolisa Phahle. She goes on to say, &#x201c;Our expo provides learners with access to information about exciting careers in the industry beyond acting and presenting. Furthermore, by interacting with learners at this point of their schooling means it is possible to make their dreams come true as they still have time to make sure they focus on the subjects that are needed to enter the industry .&#x201d; Helped by M-Net teams who will showcase the technical and creative skills required, the expo will take the learners on a journey of how television is made in a fun and interactive learning environment. In addition, hosting the event at Sasani Studios which produces many popular South African shows like The Voice SA, helps to simulate a real life television production experience for the learners. They will also have the opportunity to meet some familiar faces, namely Andile Gumbi and Gcina Mkhize from Mzansi Magic flagship soap Isibaya, when they participate as extras in a mock Isibaya scene. This activity introduces the learners to a real set and the behind-the-scenes of how the series is produced.
