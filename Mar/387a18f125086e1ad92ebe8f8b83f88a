&#x201c;Five design trends stood out for me when I was at EuroShop 2017,&#x201d; says Justin Hawes, MD of Scan Display. EuroShop is the world&#x2019;s leading trade fair of solutions for the retail industry, including exhibition and display products, point of sale, and shop fitting. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very important that we attend this show,&#x201d; explains Hawes, &#x201c;as it is the single biggest platform to discover all of the latest developments and improvements that our industry is achieving internationally. It inspires our designers and ensures we are always taking advantage of the best technologies and materials that are available.&#x201d; These are the five design trends that Hawes saw at EuroShop, across all 18 exhibition halls (with a net floor space of 128 000m2) where 2,367 exhibitors from 61 countries were vying to outshine each other with their dazzling displays. Trend #1 &#x2013; Fabric You might be thinking this is nothing new, and you&#x2019;d be right. Fabric has been around for the past 10 years, during which time &#x2013; paired with aluminum frames &#x2013; it has displaced wood and vinyl as the preferred structure for stands. What is new is that the fabric prints are bigger and better than ever before. &#x201c;Maximum widths of 5 metres have enabled huge seamless graphics to take over, sometimes as long as 15 metres,&#x201d; says Justin. &#x201c;And the printing is of a better quality, allowing for incredibly vibrant images.&#x201d; A large seamless graphic with a shelving inlay. Trend #2 &#x2013; Lighting LED lighting is also not new, but the innovation that is driving it is. A range of luminous intensities and colours provide custom lighting options, so that different moods and effects can be achieved. Justin says, &#x201c;In the past, lighting was very bright and monotone. We saw a range of softer lighting effects making an entrance at this year&#x2019;s show.&#x201d; An impressive light box on a 90-degree corner. Trend #3 &#x2013; Backlighting It should be no surprise that better fabrics together with better lighting have resulted in better backlighting. Hawes explains, &#x201c;Advanced LEDs are being used, and the scale and quality of backlighting options has grown, allowing for lightboxes of a size and standard not seen before.&#x201d; The Fairnet stand featured a large LED screen and real fish tanks as counters. Trend #4 &#x2013; Natural wood In sharp contrast to the sophisticated new technologies appearing on stands, the use of one of the oldest exhibition stand materials was another trend; natural wood. It is used free of paint, varnish or other finishes. This effect is visually striking, especially when its organic texture is juxtaposed with the sleeker synthetic materials that are commonly used in exhibitions. This stand used raw wood pallets to construct book shelves and clad counters. &#x201c;Additionally, natural wood is a sustainable design trend, which means it is likely to continue to grow for some time yet,&#x201d; adds Hawes. Trend #5 &#x2013; Less is more EuroShop exhibitors had fewer AV screens and less marketing collateral on their stands. &#x201c;By bypassing looped videos and brochures, the emphasis was solely on engaging with people and talking to them about their specific needs and interests,&#x201d; says Hawes. &#x201c;This is a far more personal and memorable experience. It is also what exhibitions are essentially about; meeting with people and face-to-face marketing.&#x201d; This tower structure is made from unfinished wooden blocks. EuroShop takes place every three years in D sseldorf, Germany. The next trade fair will run from 16 to 20 February 2020.
