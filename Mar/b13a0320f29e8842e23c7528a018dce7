Scenes from the Groote Post market Driving through the clouds of dust created by the car in front of us, we made our way down a dusty dirt road in Darling Hills last weekend. Spotting little roadside markers along the way promising a fun day out, we were eager to sit on rural hay bales and sample the rustic wares of food trucks and stalls offering mouthwatering wares like pulled pork-and-slaw rolls, pannekoek with cinnamon or apple sauce, jars of bacon jam, ploughman&#x2019;s platters brimming with soft cheeses and charcuterie, and more with relish. Much, much more. Following the sounds of country-rock tunes we were surprised to find them being played live by resident DJ Riaan from Old School Entertainment, then echoed throughout the estate to all the shaded seating areas across rolling lawns of the estate. There are many to choose from but I&#x2019;d recommend you get there early as those prime shady spots under the impressive oak trees fill up fast. On the Sunday of our visit, those spots were filled with families having fun in the sun, laughing and singing and queuing for food as well as for their turn to scramble about in big blue inflatable water-balls, or to hop aboard for pony and open-bed tractor rides through the private game camp and vineyards (this is fun but you&#x2019;ll be bouncing around on those same scratchy hay bales, so dress accordingly). There&#x2019;s also this impressive option (not during the market, though)&#x2026; Book your @grootepost #farmdrive #gamedrive #wine #viewsfordays #tablemountain #atlanticocean #vineyards #quagga #game #giraffe #kudu #springbok #eland #wildebeest #oryx #westcoastsa #darling #klinkawards #satourism #sauvignonblanc @westcoastwaysa #winetasting #summer #2016 #2017 A post shared by Groote Post Vineyards (@grootepost) on Nov 13, 2016 at 9:04am PST This is a proper summer weekend day out for the family with everyone from babies shaded in strollers to face-painted toddlers in 'I heart Yzer' tees, grampas with walking sticks and dogs on leashes &#x2013; these are for sale and hire at the market, in case you forget (the leashes, not the grampas and dogs) &#x2013; smiling and savouring the afternoon. The dusty car and hay-prickled bum at the end of the day are well worth it! If you missed the first two markets of summer 2017 you&#x2019;re in luck as there are you can still attend between 10am and 3pm on 26 March and 30 April before the market closes for winter. I'll probably be there myself, stocking up on jars of heavenly bacon jam. See you there! Entry is free of charge.
