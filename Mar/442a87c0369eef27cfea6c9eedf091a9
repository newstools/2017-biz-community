It will have the same effect as removing 500,000 cars from the roads. "Climate change has profound implications for our company and for the communities where we work," said AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito. "Cutting back on fossil fuels is good for the environment and good for business and we are committed to helping drive positive change." AB InBev&#x2019;s plan is to secure 75%-85% of electricity through direct power purchasing agreements. The remaining 15%-25% will come mainly from onsite technologies such as solar panels. At this stage there appears to be no major renewable plans for SA. Through Belgian beer brand Stella Artois the group is also driving a water-related conservation programme with Water.org, founded by US actor Matt Damon. The partnership aims to help bring clean water to more than 3.5-million people in the developing world. Source: Business Day
