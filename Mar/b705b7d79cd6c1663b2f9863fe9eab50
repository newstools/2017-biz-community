In November 2015, LexisNexis South Africa, part of RELX Group, acquired Korbitec from the Naspers Group, and established LexisNexis South Africa as the leader in conveyancing solutions in the local legal market. &#x201c;With our acquisition, and the merging of organisations into one, it is important for us to establish the right brand within South Africa in order to add value to all our stakeholders,&#x201d; remarks Thabo Molefe, LexisNexis South Africa Commercial Director. &#x201c;We have been working behind the scenes researching and strategising for a number of months,&#x201d; adds Boomtown MD Andrew MacKenzie. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re all about allowing our people and clients to realise their possibility. And through our in-depth research when it&#x2019;s time to roll out the proposition to market, LexisNexis will be another brand we&#x2019;ve helped do just that.&#x201d; LexisNexis South Africa stakeholders will begin seeing the evolved value proposition in 2017.
