To take part in the challenge, learners aged 6-13 must complete 10 questions on the Fast Kids Maths mobi-site within 15 minutes. This will give learners the chance to win 1 of 20 bursaries to the value of R10,000 each. Learners can also receive instant rewards, which include food vouchers, movie tickets and digital rewards such as career badges, trophies and double their in-game coins to use within the digital shop. In addition, the top 20 learners on the leader board and their moms will win a weekend away at the Ready for Life Academy. The academy will provide the kids with a chance to experience maths-focused games and activities, meet guest speakers and learn more about the careers in maths where they can excel. The Ready For Life Maths Challenge is found within the OMO Fast Kids game, which is targeted at learners from grade 1-12. The game aims to help South Africa&#x2019;s children increase their marks by developing their mathematics skills through varying levels of maths drills. The game as a whole uses a reward system that helps encourage frequent engagement and offers a fun, interactive way for learners to explore the world of maths. Parents and teachers can also join in the maths adventure and monitor the progress of learners through a registration process. Omo marketing manager Henry Muchauraya, concludes, &#x201c;We are excited about the Ready for Life Maths Challenge, which allows learners to engage and be rewarded while improving and testing their maths skills. We look forward to seeing the results and empowering the learners through bursaries that can impact their future opportunities.&#x201d; For more information, go to www.omofastkids.co.za.
