Focus groups have long been used by brands and marketing teams to better understand a customer&#x2019;s perception of a certain topic. While most think they are simply a Q&A session, they are so much more and offer real, tangible value. With the right structure, planning and moderator, focus groups can become interactive and informative conversations between participants that will help them express their feelings and opinions around the topic at hand. Focus groups are not a one-size-fits-all approach to understanding customers and their needs, but if the right direction is applied, they will offer important information that can affect business decisions, such as: Buyer&#x2019;s emotional states and what makes them happy Behaviours that trigger purchases How brands are perceived How products are perceived</li></li></li>Key questions and discussion points A definitive question needs to guide the entire process so that an end result can be attained. Once the client has decided what question needs to be answered or what problem needs to be solved, the focus group moderator can plan the procedure that will lead participants towards finding an answer to the question or a solution to the problem. Throughout the focus group, a number of different questions will be asked and the answers thereto will contribute towards the final conclusion. These questions will fit into the following categories: Engagement questions &#x2013; to get participants involved in the flow of conversation in a comfortable and non-invasive manner Exploration questions &#x2013; to get to the crux of the matter and uncover key insights Exit questions &#x2013; to wrap up the focus group and see if there are any areas that are still needing a little deeper work</li></li>There is so much more that needs to be considered when planning and executing on a focus group.
