General manager of the hotel, Jennifer Reichgelt says, &#x201c;Owing to the nature of the work being done, we will close the hotel for three months from the 25 May to 25 August 2017, although some work will commence prior to the closure.&#x201d; One element of the work involves the conversion of the existing conference facilities into 10 additional bedrooms. Reichgelt reassures guests that, &#x201c;We do not anticipate any negative impact on our guests during this period before the closure. Work will take place from 9am to 4pm from Monday to Friday. Other work being done at the property includes refurbishment of all public areas and bedrooms. The new dining offering at the hotel is bound to prove popular both with guests and visitors as well as local residents. The New York- styled steakhouse, Hussar Grill, will be opening at the hotel. With all these improvements we can truly say that this is the beginning of a new chapter in the establishment&#x2019;s history.
