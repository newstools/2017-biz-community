&#x201c;With magic and friendship, and adventures for all, there's so much to discover in Zahramay Falls! Take off on magical adventures with Shimmer and Shine!&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the introduction to Shimmer and Shine, which follows the adventures of two genies-in-training, but you can also watch the short intro embedded below: The show&#x2019;s creator Esnaashari-Charmatz is that rare creature who has worked at one company and found her niche there over the past decade. Having completed an internship with Nickelodeon (called a Nicktern, I kid you not), while completing a Bachelor&#x2019;s Degree in Entertainment Art at the California State University, she wanted to work with the network that gave her that start, and so learned all she could about animation and preschool at the Nickelodeon Animation Studio. Esnaashari-Charmatz.Talking us through the highlights of her ten-year career so far, she shares that she started off as a production assistant on My Life as a Teenage Robot, then was hired as the post-coordinator on Go, Diego, Go! After that she became the post-production supervisor on Dora the Explorer, Ni Hao Kai-lan and various other projects at Nick. It&#x2019;s then that she started pitching to Nick Jr, and she shares that she pitched various projects for five years before landing on Shimmer and Shine. In each of those positions she learned valuable lessons that helped better prepare her for what she&#x2019;s doing on Shimmer and Shine today. The biggest challenge for her is continuing to learn and grow each day and pushing herself further than the day before, no matter what the position. Now known for her knowledge and understanding of how to "fix it in post," she has what she calls a &#x201c;built-in preschool audience&#x201d; of two children at home. She adds: &#x201c;The only person who can ever stand in your way is you. Work hard, be humble, learn every day, and set goals for yourself. Be able to self-assess and be honest with yourself about your strengths and weaknesses, because only then will you truly grow.&#x201d; Esnaashari-Charmatz concludes that the Cape Town International Animation Festival was an excellent opportunity to meet with some of those up-and-coming artists of SA's industry, so make sure you&#x2019;re there next year!
