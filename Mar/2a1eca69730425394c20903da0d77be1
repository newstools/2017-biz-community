Marketers across the government and business sectors face the challenge of staying up to speed with knowing what their consumers&#x2019; needs and interests are, in order to efficiently deliver products and services that meet the requirements of these audience segments. Join AMASA Joburg as we host Donald Liphoko, Director-General of Government Communication & Information System (GCIS). Donald will unpack the thinking and methodology behind the newly launched Government Segmentation Model. Even though his main responsibility is to lead South African Government Communications programmes and drive coherent country communication to citizens at home and abroad, he is no stranger to the media and advertising fraternity. Donald&#x2019;s presentation will provide an overview of the journey taken to produce the Government Segmentation Model, which is a truly unique and innovative platform which will enable communicators and government officials to better understand the needs of South Africa&#x2019;s diverse audiences. As the media and advertising fraternity is presented with this segmentation model, let&#x2019;s integrate and explore the different ways that it can be used within our industry to offer the best solutions to our clients. The AMASA Committee looks forward to hosting you at the March Forum: Date: Wednesday, 8 March 2017 Time: 16h30 for 17h00 (business networking after forum session) Venue: Sandton City (Ster-Kinekor) - Ground Floor, Sandton City, Rivonia Road, Sandton
