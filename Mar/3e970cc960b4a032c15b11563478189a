Multichoice South Africa Holdings has broken this prestige event's 16-year record, by being designated a finalist in four major categories: Top Empowered Company in Socio-economic Development Award , Skills Development Award, Enterprise & Supplier Development Award, Top Empowered Business of the Year Award. Fellow finalists this year include McKinsey & Company, a legend of empowerment, which has won four more Oliver Top Empowerment Awards over the years. The Oliver Top Empowerment Awards has never been more relevant than it is today, against the backdrop of government's recent call for accelerated economic transformation. Affectionately termed &#x201c;The Olivers&#x201d;, in honour of revered namesake Oliver Tambo, South Africa's premier showcase for leadership researches, ranks and recognises outstanding leaders &#x2013; both organisations and individuals &#x2013; exemplifying vision, innovation, leadership and, most of all, action in the name of transformation. In doing so it motivates all stakeholders in South Africa's socioeconomic development to pursue equally measurable empowerment-based success. Winners will be announced on 30 March 2017 at the Birchwood Hotel.
