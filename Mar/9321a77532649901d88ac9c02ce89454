Though I&#x2019;m slowly making my way through the growing list of attractions &#x2013; Entertainer app in tow &#x2013; there&#x2019;s one experience I can&#x2019;t believe I didn&#x2019;t do sooner, and that&#x2019;s touring the city riding pillion on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Lauren Hartzenberg Admittedly, the appeal of it was initially lost on me as I (falsely) thought the experience to be targeted at petrolheads with an appreciation of the bikes themselves. But not so, as I learnt on a recent trip with Harley Davidson Chauffeur Rides in the run up to the Cape Town International Jazz Festival. Harley-Davidson is a lifestyle. And based on my interaction with the passionate Harley owners and drivers on our tour, the love they have for their bikes is equalled by their excitement for the magnificent places their motorcycles are able to take them &#x2013; and it&#x2019;s infectious. Mountains, coastlines and valleys Our journey began in the city centre. Traversing the CBD traffic with ease, we were soon cruising through the cosmopolitan seaside suburbs of Sea Point and Camps Bay before entering the slightly sleepier Hout Bay &#x2013; or the Republic of Hout Bay as it&#x2019;s affectionately called by the locals. Lauren Hartzenberg Chapman&#x2019;s Peak Drive was next, considered one of the country&#x2019;s most scenic routes for good reason. The 9km toll road ribbons along the Atlantic coastline offering spectacular vistas of the ocean and surrounding mountains, and is dotted with picnic spots to take in all those Instagram-worthy views. From here we headed through leafy Noordhoek, along the Ou Kaapse Weg mountain pass and through the Constantia Wine Valley, before making our way back into the city centre.

There was an amusing showmanship to it all too, with the convoy of Harleys inspiring curious stares, waves and cheers from the suburbs&#x2019; pedestrians and others on the road. Lauren Hartzenberg Touring Cape Town on two wheels was like seeing it with a new set of eyes. Feeling the autumn sun kiss my cheeks and inhaling the scent of the ocean as we cruised around the city marvelling at its diverse landscapes has elevated my idea of what sightseeing is all about.
