Three teasers and a mini documentary that had us talking to some of the smartest people in the country (and also abroad) about whether the AI apocalypse is a real thing (spoiler alert: it&#x2019;s not). We shot the teasers in one day across three locations with three cameras and three of the most remarkable individuals who proved that they are more than their collected data. The doccie was trickier&#x2026; We interviewed several experts from as far as Nashville and created an audio bed before locking down our imagery. Who better to pull a script from than the people who ACTUALLY spend their days thinking and working with data? We ended up with over 13 hours of audio to cut down to 6 minutes before we started hunting for imagery. We could not have done any of this without the generosity, enthusiasm and patience of all the experts and artists involved. Have a look - we couldn&#x2019;t be prouder.
