It is reported that Vault 7 "Dark Matter" contains documentation for several CIA projects that infect Apple Mac firmware (meaning the infection persists even if the operating system is re-installed) developed by the CIA's Embedded Development Branch (EDB). Apple's claim that it has "fixed" all "vulnerabilities" described in DARKMATTER is duplicitous. EFI is a systemic problem, not a zero-day.&#x2014; WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 24, 2017 According to WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, the organisation only published 1% of the information it has discovered. #Julain_Assange: The #CIA has become a giant #hacker #spy agency!

The CIA's "Sonic Screwdriver" infector is stored on the modified firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter.
