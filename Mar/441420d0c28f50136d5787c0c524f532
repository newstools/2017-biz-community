The beer celebrates the eclectic flavours of the Orient with a tip of the hat to England's long-standing tradition of turning barley and hops into a golden pint. Taking its name from Cathay Pacific&#x2019;s first aircraft, Betsy is a uniquely crafted brew containing Dragon Fruit and New Territories honey from Hong Kong, along with Fuggle Hops grown in Kent and used in English breweries for centuries. Unlike its highly-hopped counterparts, Betsy is a wheat-based beer with a higher carbonation level than ordinary brews, heightening the sense of taste and delivering a punch of flavour with less bitterness and more aroma.
