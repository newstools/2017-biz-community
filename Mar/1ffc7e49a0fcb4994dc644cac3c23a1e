According to Dele Alimi, managing director of Clarion Events West Africa, &#x201c;The industry stakeholders are enormously excited about MMWA as it will adequately reposition the transportation and logistics sector.&#x201d; According to Alimi, the industry which used to be noted for its huge contribution to the nation&#x2019;s economy, has struggled to retain its position as a result of the economic downturn. Fostering economic development He added that as part of the commitment by Clarion Event Wests Africa to deliver value and reinforce the essence of the exhibition and as one with capacity to foster economic development, especially at such a crucial time in the country; MMWA will run concurrently with the Nigeria Manufacturing Equipment Expo (NME) and the Nigerian Raw Material Expo (NIRAM) at the Landmark Expo Centre. Some of the key players that will exhibit at MMWA include Sifax Group, DSV, St. John Logistics, Nigeria Ports Authority, Nigeria Railways Corporation, NIMASA, IAL Nigeria Limited, KSP Shipping Logistics, Chibyke Global Systems Limited, African Atlantic International Agencies Limited, Inland Containers Nigeria, Chartered Institute of Transport & Logistics, Association of Nigeria Licensed Custom Agents, and more. Timothy Zalanga, director corporate planning, representing the Nigeria Railway Corporation, stated that the Federal Government in its determination to revive and modernise the railway system in line with the 25 year strategic vision, adopted a systematic dual approach of implementation. Rehabilitation He also indicated that the rehabilitation entails the entire existing narrow gauge lines simultaneously with the development of standard gauge lines which will link the seaports, airports and cargo terminals. &#x201c;The development of the rail system will provide a cheaper, safer and more reliable means of transportation. It will offer the economy a better alternative to road transportation of goods and heavy freight going to far destinations.&#x201d; Other key industry bodies supporting MMWA include the Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport (CILT) Nigeria while the Nigeria Ports Authority is the event patron. More than 80 exhibitors are expected, including freight forwarders, ship owners, shipping lines, ports & terminal operators as well as official government bodies.
