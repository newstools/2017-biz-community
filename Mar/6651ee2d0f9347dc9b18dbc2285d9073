Not only will the four super-luxury suites at The Manor House be supported by the dedicated team at the Queen Victoria Hotel, the butler service here will be second to none. From booking theatre tickets to unpacking luggage, the butlers at The Manor House will all be specially trained to perform a wide range of duties for the discerning guests that these suites will appeal to. The suites enjoy unrivaled and uninterrupted views of Table Mountain, each with their very own private patio or Juliet balcony. Guests can expect in-room amenities by Molton Brown - made from the world's most precious ingredients. A private dining room will also be available for up to six guests at a time for that extra exclusive dining experience. All menus will be tailored to specific guests&#x2019; preferences and prepared by the Queen Victoria Hotel&#x2019;s top rated restaurant, Dash. Guests can use either of the sister hotels&#x2019; facilities - from their new artisanal-style all day dining restaurant Ginja, fully functional gym (available 24 hours); to relaxing spa treatments at the Sanctuary Signature Spa next door, as well as full conference facilities at The Forum. Newly renovated and decorated, the interiors were designed by Francois du Plessis. The Queen Victoria Hotel&#x2019;s General Manager, Theunie Marais says: &#x201c;The Manor House is elegant and modern with understated luxury and glamour, offering every comfort for our guests.&#x201d; In close proximity to the hustle and bustle of the Waterfront, The Manor House is tucked away, quietly exclusive and provides an appealing and contrasting haven of luxury. Neil Markovitz, Newmark&#x2019;s managing director adds: &#x201c;The Manor House completes our vision of creating the Newmark resort-like offering at our Waterfront properties &#x2013; where guests feel like they get more value because they chose to stay with us.&#x201d; The Manor House opens early May 2017.
