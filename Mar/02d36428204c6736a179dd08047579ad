Drawing much of the attention as one of the headline attractions is none other than Nikki du Plessis, the current reigning Miss Nude SA. The South African model ranked number 39 in SA FHM&#x2019;s Top 100 sexiest women in 2012, after which she went on to travel the USA, was featured on Playboy.com and Playboy Plus and then became the South African Miss April 2014 Playboy Playmate. This local beauty and international sensation will be at Sexpo 2017 to sign autographs and pose for photos. Additionally, entries for Miss Nude 2017 are now open. Entry is as simple as sending a clear photo and a description through to Sexpo, who will then send entrants an application form for completion. The finalists will be announced the week before Sexpo via social media platforms and the winner of Miss Nude SA 2017 will be announced on Saturday 25 March at Sexpo 2017. The grand reveal will take place at the Main Stage at 21.15pm. Anyone who feels that they have what it takes to become the next Miss Nude SA can send a motivational write up and picture to az.oc.opxes&#64;edunssim . The winner will receive a R20,000 cash prize. Entertainment lineup The 2017 entertainment lineup includes Pricasso, the all-time favourite penile painter, the Theatre Erotic, Sexpo workshops and Man Cave strip poker. Don&#x2019;t forget the array of lounges available to cater to all tastes ranging from a sexy Swingers Lounge, a BDSM play area, a Teasers Lounge, and for the ladies, a Teaze-Hers Lounge. Bearing in mind that education and health are integral parts, Sexpo&#x2019;s managing director Sean Newman says, &#x201c;Sexpo is about exploring the full spectrum of the sensual side of life, rather than pure sexuality &#x2013; catering to all interests and tastes. Sexpo is a destination lifestyle exhibition that provides a safe space for everyone regardless of race, age or sexuality, or whether you&#x2019;re daring or shy. There&#x2019;s something for everyone to explore and enjoy.&#x201d; Sexpo will also be hosting a sizzling four-day main attraction &#x2013; the Thunder from Down Under Stage show. This will include Australian performers pulling off erotic dance routines in the specifically designated Thunder Dome area. A Sexpo ticket provides access to the shows, which run from 7.30pm on Wednesday and Thursday, 8pm on Friday and 12 midday and 7pm on Saturday. The doors open one hour prior to each show and seating is on a first come first serve basis.
