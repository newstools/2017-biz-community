To deliver this SD-WAN service, Orange will integrate Riverbed SteelConnect technology into its hybrid network portfolio. The two companies are working together to develop a virtual network function (VNF) that customers will be able to deploy on universal customer premise equipment (uCPE) at their site. Full compatibility will be maintained with existing services as enterprises transition applications to the cloud. Riverbed&#x2019;s SD-WAN offering, SteelConnect, reportedly provides an intelligent and simplified approach to designing, deploying, and managing hybrid networks. The first Orange pilot customers will be connected during the second quarter 2017 using managed SteelConnect appliances. The VNF of the service is scheduled to be available at the end of 2017. This will provide full virtualisation and orchestration managed through a &#x2018;self-care&#x2019; portal to administer and prioritise applications. This launch is a key part of the Orange network-as-a-service strategy, and the solution will be available globally.
