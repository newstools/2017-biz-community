Tailoring email to the recipient Every big brand is invested in email marketing to some degree. Some make it a huge focal point, while others simply allocate the remaining portion of their budget to email. The problem is that very few brands experience much of a return. They&#x2019;re just going through the motions because that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;ve been told to do. In order for email to be a relevant form of communication/marketing for your brand in 2017 and beyond, you have to focus on being relevant to your customers. They don&#x2019;t want to read boring emails about what sort of things have been going on within your organisation over the last month. They want to read about things that apply to them. They crave personalised attention and you need to deliver it. In other words, email is still relevant if the content you&#x2019;re sending is relevant to your customers. How to keep your email relevant &#x201c;According to a 2015 study in Business Insider, just over one-third (33.1%) of Americans check their email regularly throughout the day,&#x201d; explains Paul Manzey of ResortsandLodges.com. &#x201c;Another 16% check their email 4-6 times per day on average. The proliferation of mobile devices allows people to be connected to social media, messaging, and email at all times, making marketing through these channels a non-negotiable.&#x201d; If you find it difficult to keep your emails relevant for recipients, here are some pointers that may be helpful. 1. Personalise the content Thanks to advanced email marketing platforms, it&#x2019;s easier than ever to personalise emails to the recipient. Not only can you insert commands that personally address each recipient by their name, but you can also throw in other details that are related to their buying preferences, purchase history, location, and more. 2. Shift the focus If you aren&#x2019;t sure how relevant your emails are, try this little exercise. Review the last ten emails you&#x2019;ve sent to customers and analyse each one paragraph by paragraph. Grab a sticky note and create two columns: me and them. Now, as you review each paragraph, make a tally mark in the &#x201c;me&#x201d; column when the focal point of that paragraph is about the company and a tally mark in the &#x201c;them&#x201d; column when it&#x2019;s about the customer. What you&#x2019;ll discover from this simple exercise is that the majority of your content is self-centred. The truth of the matter is that your customers don&#x2019;t care about what you&#x2019;re doing. They want to know how it affects them. Once you shift the focus, your email marketing efforts will become more relevant to the audience. 3. Ask for feedback A lot of companies complain about not getting enough feedback from customers. But in many cases, the reason they don&#x2019;t get a lot of feedback is that they don&#x2019;t ask for it. If you want to know how you&#x2019;re doing, start gathering feedback and see what people are saying. You may be surprised by what you hear. Make sure you&#x2019;re doing email right Email marketing is still very relevant in 2017 &#x2013; but you have to go about it in the right manner. Sending out generic emails that ramble about what your company has been doing over the last month isn&#x2019;t beneficial. Today&#x2019;s customer wants personalised information that pertains to them. If you&#x2019;re able to deliver this type of content, you shouldn&#x2019;t have any trouble realising a healthy return.
