World Travel & Tourism Council via Wikimedia CommonsAccording to Eyewitness news, "President Jacob Zuma has wielded the axe, firing Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom, Transport Minister Dipuo Peters and Public Service and Administration Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi, in one of his most dramatic moves during his time in the Union Buildings." Times Live provides an easy-to-understand list of who got chopped&#x201a; who got shifted and who will be breathing a sigh of relief. Some maintain that Hanekom was looking to be fired after he proposed a vote of no confidence in Zuma at an ANC national executive meeting last November. He has been replaced by Tokozile Xasa as tourism minister. Many have lauded Hanekom for the work he has done to grow South Africa's tourism industry which has seen significant growth over the past two years. South Africa saw the arrival of more than 10 million visitors in 2016 - the industry supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes a significant contribution to the country's GDP. Steps have been taken to capitalise on the growing conferencing and events industry with Treasury allocating R120m to bring more business events to SA and visa restrictions have been relaxed which saw a significant boost in tourism numbers. More emphasis has been put on supporting and attracting small tourism enterprises and utilising tourism as a tool for socio-economic growth - these are just a few of the strides that have been made in the industry to the benefit of the entire economy. Says Hanekom: &#x201c;Tourism touches the lives of all South Africans. Given its importance to our economy, we must continue to nurture the sector and drive increasingly impactful and collaborative strategies and programmes for sustained, inclusive growth.&#x201d; Industry reacts: .@Derek_Hanekom THANK YOU #DerekHanekom for being such a courageous leader & for your exceptionally commendable work as min. of SA tourism&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#x2014; IG: Iga Motylska (@IgaMotylska) March 31, 2017 THANK YOU @Derek_Hanekom for your continuous efforts to build tourism in South Africa.
