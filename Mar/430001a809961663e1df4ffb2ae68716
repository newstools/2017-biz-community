Williams&#x2018;See money differently&#x2019; with Nedbank is all about the consumers, not the brand, and about changing their behaviour with money. It&#x2019;s about seeing money for the potential it has, because money well managed can make a real difference to achieving your goals and building a relationship with your money starts with a simple conversation. The new ad, &#x2018;Tale of note&#x2019;, supports the bank&#x2019;s new promise, as Williams adds: &#x201c;South Africa is one of the worst savings' nations in the world. As part of their repositioning in the market, Nedbank used this insight to create a commercial that exposes people to the fact that money is neither good nor bad, but rather your behaviour that defines it. &#x201c;The 'Tale of note' is a compelling story about the different sides of money. It&#x2019;s a brave and progressive idea that makes you think and re-evaluate your relationship with money.&#x201d; The ad is embedded below, in case you've not yet seen it: It is already receiving a positive response as it has formed an emotional connection with consumers. In some comments across Joe Public and Nedbank&#x2019;s Twitter, Facebook and YouTube social media platforms, customers have already commented that they love the location, visuals and the concept behind the entire ad: Click through to Ann Nurock&#x2019;s feedback on the brand repositioning launch live at Design Indaba last week and follow Nedbank, Joe Public and the #SeeMoneyDifferently hashtag on Twitter for the latest updates.
