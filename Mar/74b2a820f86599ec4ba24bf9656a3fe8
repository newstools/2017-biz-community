The debut of this international comedy show will host an eclectic mix of both local and international headliners such as the hilarious African comedic great Ayo Makun who goes by the stage name AY from Nigeria. He is also an actor, writer, director, radio and TV presenter. The ever ludicrous, funny and fearless Kansiime will also lead the pack, gracing South Africa for the first time. Born in Uganda, Kansiime has won multiple awards such as Comedy YouTube Sub-Saharan Africa Creator Award and African Entertainment Awards USA, and Best Comedian's Award 2015, to name a few. The local lineup includes retired lawyer and &#x2018;laugh technician&#x2019; Thenjiwe who's apparently lodged a complaint with the Knowles family claiming Beyonce is her daughter. The multi-talented Trevor Gumbi, Tumi Stopnonsons and Nina Hastie are also bound to leave viewers in stitches. The witty and energetic Tallassmo features front and centre of the show as MC.
