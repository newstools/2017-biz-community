That&#x2019;s why the team sent through this &#x2018;rock on&#x2019; emoji to show how they&#x2019;re currently feeling. &#x201c;We felt privileged to share the stage with such amazing talent. Agencies are more focussed on driving great ROI for their clients than ever before. The best tools and skills are essential in delivering great campaigns for clients. Our Ad Ops team did is making sure that they offer our clients the best of the best. We are very proud of their performance,&#x201d; says Diavastos. The 25AM team based in CT: Nathan Johnston, Rowan Nelson, Charl van der Merwe. She adds that it was also exciting to see the amazing young talent in the industry as there is a skills shortage in the digital industry and seeing the young talent makes her excited about where we are heading as an industry. Obviously they&#x2019;re also very proud of their own Kirsten van Rooyen, who Diavastos describes as a strategy superstar. Kirsten van Rooyen and Nicola Kuschke of 25AM at The Bookmarks 2017.
