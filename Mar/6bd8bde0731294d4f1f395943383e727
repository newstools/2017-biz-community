Iran Air received its first Airbus, an A321 used for domestic flights, on 12 January 2017. It completed a deal for 100 Airbus planes with a list price of around US$20 billion on 22 December 2016, after approval from Washington as some parts are manufactured in the United States. Limits on atomic programme The purchase, along with a historic deal with US manufacturer Boeing, followed a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers lifted some sanctions in 2016, in return for limits on Tehran's atomic programme. Boeing has said the contract for 80 planes, also finalised in December - Iran's first with a US aviation firm since its 1979 Islamic revolution - was worth US$16.6 billion. The Islamic republic projects a demand for between 400 and 500 new commercial airliners over the next decade. Source: AFP
