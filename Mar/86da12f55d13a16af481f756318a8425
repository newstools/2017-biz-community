And, if I may add that the weather in October is also excellent.&#x201d; Chief executive of CINEA, Gaelen Bresson adds that the Seychellois nation is made up of the first settlers - the slaves and their European masters, the Indian and Arabs spice traders, and the Chinese who came to trade. &#x201c;This is who we are as Creole, as Seychellois, a melting pot of cultures, so it is fitting that the carnival is held during the Creole festival, a time when we celebrate our identity, our rich, diverse culture,&#x201d; said Bresson. Besson adds that with the two festivals combined, visitors and locals alike will still see a multi-coloured, multi-cultural facade on the streets of Victoria.
