This allows them to have a realistic look at a career with Monsanto. They gain valuable professional experience and developmental input,&#x201d; said du Plessis. Following a rigorous assessment, successful applicants will have the opportunity to be part of the company and will be based at the Johannesburg head office, where they will benefit from the mentorship of the Monsanto Leadership team.
