Image via MitsubishiMitsubishi is one of several vehicle manufacturers affected by the potentially defective airbag inflators manufactured by Takata, OEM airbag supplier. MMSA is currently busy contacting owners to arrange and co-ordinate the timing of the service inspections where airbags will be replaced at no cost. Replacement parts first need to be distributed to dealers countrywide before customers will be asked to take their vehicles to their respective dealers. The inspection and replacement procedure will take approximately one hour. A simple online VIN-checker with an FAQ-section is available on the company's website for Pajero owners who want to check if their vehicles are affected.
