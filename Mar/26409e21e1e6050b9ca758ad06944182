As a shortlisted photographer, Ndelu has been given a prestigious Sony &#x03b1;7 full frame, which she will now use to complete a second photography challenge set by the judges.

Scott Gray, CEO, World Photography Organisation, notes: &#x201c;The Student Focus competition is an integral part to the Awards program as it aims to uncover young, fresh photographic talent and works to propel them forward in their career.&#x201d; Student Focus judge Andrea Kurland adds: &#x201c;This year's shortlist helps cement why awards like these are more important than ever. The work submitted was original, thoughtful and brave - a healthy reminder that talent will always win out and rise above the noise.&#x201d; Shortlisted image and photographer background Ndelu&#x2019;s shortlisted image &#x2018;Pride of the Panther&#x2019; is a fascinating portrait of Zana Masombuka, referring to the South African student protest against the tuition fees. Interested in how the protest action moved from the &#x2018;real world&#x2019; to the &#x2018;online world&#x2019;, and carried on in places like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, the photographer chose to render her image in a way in order to highlight the role of the social media in the protest action. Describing her image, Ndelu notes: &#x201c;Zana is dressed in full black - similarly to the Black Panther Party - and I have chosen to distort, fracture and glitch the image. My image is about how we remember and where we go to remember - there are no physical monuments for the students protesting against the tuition fees. Also, I wanted to remind people of how this movement changes (changed) online, because online spaces often distort the truth and the reality.&#x201d; Based in Pretoria, South Africa, Cole Ndelu is a recent graduate of the Stellenbosch Academy of Design and Photography.
