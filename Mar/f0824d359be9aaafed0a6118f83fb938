As a first-time supporter of the reality series&#x2019; fifth season, the brand recognised the need to provide its social media followers with an entertaining, interactive bot that enhances their Braai Master viewing experience and speaks to their love of cooking with their favourite cheese products. By sending a food emoji to Lancewood&#x2019;s Facebook page, via private message, the bot instantly responds with a recipe or tip related to the emoji. As an example, Clarissa sent the brand a strawberry emoji and the bot responded with a recipe for fruit cheese salad with strawberry vinaigrette &#x2013; a delicious braai salad. &#x201c;People are often bombarded with a slew of marketing messages on brands&#x2019; Facebook pages. These posts quickly lose their appeal, as they lack the essence of what these platforms are about: engaging with customers, giving users the opportunity to receive information in a fun, educational way and speaking to their core interests via inspiring, relevant conversations,&#x201d; says Shereen Anderhold, marketing manager at Lancewood. &#x201c;We wanted to take our support of the series to another level and give followers of the series an instant offering that is attuned to their passion for social media channels. About 1,251 unique users have already tried out the bot and approximately 46,644 interactions have taken place to date. &#x201c;Being a supporter of this season of Ultimate Braai Master gives the brand the opportunity to enhance fans&#x2019; overall watching experience with great recipes to whip up at their next braai. With over a million viewers having already tuned in for the second episode, we look forward to reaching even more braai enthusiasts across the nation with our Lancewood Emoji Meals.&#x201d;
