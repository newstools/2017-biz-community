In addition to being appointed their pro bono agency, M&C Saatchi Abel has endowed a permanent photography gallery - the M&C Saatchi Abel Gallery - within the Zeitz MOCAA. &#x201c;We are delighted to be partnering with Zeitz MOCAA, which is the first major museum in Africa dedicated to contemporary art,&#x201d; says Mike Abel, founding partner and chief executive of the M&C Saatchi Abel Group of companies. &#x201c;When the opportunity arose to sponsor a gallery at Zeitz MOCAA, we recognised it as a natural extension for our commitment to South African and African art.&#x201d; Renderings of the M&C Saatchi Abel Photography Gallery Indeed, the Saatchi brand is synonymous with an ardent love of art &#x2013; the original founder, Charles Saatchi, opened his eponymous London gallery in 1985 to exhibit his vast personal collection to the public. Locally, M&C Saatchi Abel&#x2019;s newly built Johannesburg office takes its design cue from African art and culture. The agency&#x2019;s core belief in the role of art as integral to inspiring, challenging and building creative and original thought is reflected in the gallery-like reception areas and then filtered through the remaining three storeys. The Cape Town agency similarly has a wonderful collection of prized contemporary art. Works by the likes of Mohau Modisakeng, Cyrus Kabiru, Cameron Platter, Zander Blom, Sam Nhlengethwa, Kudzanai Chiurai, Christiaan Conradie, Jody Paulsen and Julia Rosa Clark reveal the agency&#x2019;s support and passion for South African art and upcoming artists like Pierre Vermeulen and Ruby Swinney.
