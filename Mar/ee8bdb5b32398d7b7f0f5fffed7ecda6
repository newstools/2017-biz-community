As sponsors of the WesBank Car of the Year (COTY) Awards, AutoTrader challenged Liquorice to amplify their involvement in the Awards with an innovative campaign that not only got car enthusiasts supporting and voting for their favourite cars, but imagining what it would be like to drive them. Get your pulse racing & your fingers ready 2 tweet ur favourite car over the finish line using its relevant hashtag! https://t.co/K9de4SaMH7 pic.twitter.com/fvFex8CNkO&#x2014; AutoTrader (@AutoTraderSA) March 14, 2017 Says founder and CEO of Liquorice, Miles Murphy: &#x201c;Our work with AutoTrader over the past four years had shown that their fans love to support their favourite new cars. So instead of getting them to just click &#x2018;Like&#x2019; or &#x2018;Retweet&#x2019;, we wanted them to put a bit of virtual fuel behind the cars they love to get them to the finish line.&#x201d; AutoTrader CEO George Mienie says: "As the leading motoring marketplace in South Africa we are thrilled to have another digital first under our belt. The #COTYDragRace has allowed us to push the boundaries and create a truly interactive social media campaign that involves all of the finalists of COTY2017 and is totally controlled by our fans. Judging from the race results yesterday the campaign has been a great success." How it works At specific times during the course of Wednesday, 15 March, users can go online to cotydragrace.liqnet.co.za where two cars from the COTY finalists will be pitted against each other in a virtual drag race. To get your car ahead, tweet your support for your chosen car with the relevant hashtag. The more you tweet, the more chance your car will end up winning and going into the next round. Preliminary rounds took place yesterday, with #COTYDragRace trending on Twitter. Join Twitter&#x2019;s first-ever virtual drag race at 2pm and 3pm today and flex your fingers for your finalist to make sure that your car is the one that gets across the checkered flag first. Follow @AutoTraderSA on Twitter to get notifications on when races are starting and news on all the drag race winners, including which finalists will really win at the COTY Awards.
