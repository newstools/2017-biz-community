Gary Allemann, MD of Master Data ManagementData mining is not a new discipline; however, it is growing in relevance as a key capability for data scientists grappling with the new data sources available through big data. Data mining is the process of collecting, searching through, and analysing data sets to discover previously unknown relationships. The eLC course defines both data mining and data science and provides a review of the concept, processes and techniques used in each area. This three-hour online training course delivers insight into the data mining process, explain models and algorithms, and give an understanding of how to match the right data mining models to the right problems. Basic requirements This course is geared towards data analysts looking to gain and extend their foundational data mining knowledge and requires a basic understanding of undergraduate statistics and data management concepts. This course extends eLc's focus on big data concepts and can contribute towards the internationally recognised Certified Information Management Professional (CIMP) accreditation in business intelligence. To achieve this certification, candidates must complete at least five courses from the eLC Business Intelligence track, and pass the associated examinations.
