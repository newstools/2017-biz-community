Rajah&#x2019;s four designs were linked to his collection&#x2019;s theme of &#x2018;Love&#x2019;. The bottles of each design were available to guests at the show and were echoed in his couture collection for 2017/18. &#x201c;This season we take our inspiration from our past prints and graphics, all inspired by love and hope,&#x201d; says Rajah. The prints for Rajah&#x2019;s collection bring together the iconic looks from the past decade with graphic designers, Room 13. &#x201c;The overarching theme of love and escapism is prevalent in this collection. Flowers, hearts, butterflies and stars all play a huge symbolic part. &#x201c;It has been exciting to work with Coca-Cola Peninsula Beverages (CCPB) on the designs for the iconic contour bottle. Symbols of love across various cultures are included on the designs. In times of despondency, we look to constants in our lives. These constants can be people, things or experiences that offer us comfort. Coca-Cola is one brand that has been around through all our experiences, from love to everything else in between. With the bottle designs, we wanted to create keepsakes that represented beautiful, iconic imagery of love and hope,&#x201d; concludes Rajah. Priscilla Urquhart, public affairs and communication manager at CCPB says, &#x201c;We were thrilled to partner with Gavin Rajah at this year&#x2019;s Fashion Week. Coca-Cola Limited edition designer bottles have previously been created for Paris and New York Fashion Weeks and it was the time for Africa to show off our design excellence through the iconic Coca-Cola contour bottle.&#x201d;
