His youthful energy and stage charisma belie his age. It's hard to imagine he is still belting out those incredibly high notes at nearly 40 years of age. As far as albums go, there have only been three so far. That all changes in 2017. Armed with a chest of freshly written material, Brandon is currently in studio to record what he says is &#x201c;some of the most honest writing I've ever allowed myself to do.&#x201d; The lead single called Spark has just gone to radio this week I caught up with Brandon after his Woordfees shows in Stellenbosch. What does music mean to you? Music is my creative outlet. Have you had any funny moments on stage? Yes. I&#x2019;ve had many. But let&#x2019;s talk about the time that we were flashed while we were on stage. Andre Schwartz and I. We were performing a very serious song, we hear a pssst. So, we both turned to the wings and got flashed good and solid &#x2013; and we had to finish the song while keeping a straight face. Who are your heroes? Most of the old cats, David Bowie and Robert Plant. It&#x2019;s your round. What are you drinking? You do know it is 8.30 in the morning? But since it&#x2019;s my round, let&#x2019;s start the day with a bang! How about a double Jamesons. What is the song you wished you wrote? There are a few. Lady Grinning Soul by David Bowie off his 1973 album Aladdin Sane. Where would your dream gig be? Glastonbury Festival. But none of that 12.00 in the day shite. I want to headline! What makes you stand out? My voice of course. But to have lasted this long in an ever-changing industry, it takes reinvention and balls of steel. These babies are made of Titanium. Do you have any nicknames? I don&#x2019;t have many. Friends call me B. But I am sure there are a few names people call me behind my back. If you were not a musician, what would you do? I&#x2019;d be an assassin, without a doubt. But don&#x2019;t tell Gerrie Nel. Pick five words to describe yourself. Cool. Calm (mostly). Professional. Electric. Unpredictable. What five discs would you take to a deserted island? Don&#x2019;t Worry Be Happy. (Just washed up on shore. Let the party begin!) &#x2013; Bobby Mc Ferrin Can&#x2019;t Stop the Feelin&#x2019; (When I&#x2019;m still loving the solitude) &#x2013; Justin Timberlake Sail Away, Sail Away (when I&#x2019;ve had enough of sea and sand and fish) - Enya Hurricane &#x2013; 30 seconds to Mars Three Little Birds &#x2013; Bob Marley (When the sun comes out again and I realise it&#x2019;s a blast to be on that island. Jah man!) What was the greatest movie ever made? The Godfather Trilogy &#x2013; all the hallmarks of a great movie. Great actors, great script, great director&#x2026;. and all that other stuff guys like &#x2013; skiet, skop en donner! What is your favourite fashion garment? Hats What do you complain about most often? Don&#x2019;t get me started&#x2026; Our president, for a start; corruption; lack of service delivery; and these days, kids don&#x2019;t seem to have any manners. What is your fear? It&#x2019;s that I am not fully utilising all that I am and all that I have. Happiness is... As Eddie Murphy said in Metro &#x2013; &#x2018;Nekkid in Tahiti&#x2019; On stage I tend to... Go into the zone and kick ass. If you were walking on stage for a keynote speech, what song would you use? Here comes the Hotstepper. Galantis &#x2013; No Money. What are you doing next? Finally getting around to completing an album/s that I should have completed a long time ago. My muse is back baby! www.brandonoctober.com
