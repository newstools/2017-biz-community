Gone are the old boxed-shaped bodies of old and in strides the F Sport with its low, attack-mode crouch, gaping air intakes, bold black grille, slit-eyed day-time running lights, sloping lined hood and fat 18-inch alloys wrapped in low-profile rubber. The living quarters have also been elegantly smartened up with a striking red-stitched leather steering wheel, more red stitching on the central panel, race track-like wrap-around front seats, re-designed instrument panel and a bigger, much clearer display screen which provides easy access to a range of functions. Eco, normal, sport A feature destined to become a driver-pleaser is a knob on the centre console with which the driver can select between three driving modes &#x2013; eco, normal and sport. Left in frugal Eco mode the sleek Lexus purrs along quietly. One click to Normal speed things up a bit but another click, this time into Sport mode, the IS 350 becomes quite enthusiastic. In this enthusiastic mode, the 8-speed cog-swopping process happens rapidly and the suspension set-up tightens when the 3.5-litre V6 flexes its 233kW/378Nm of muscle-power. The Lexus feels pleasantly lively in this mode although I wonder how much sharper it would be if the six-cylinder engine with its delightful growl, is turbo-boosted. It would certainly make the F Sport much more competitive against opponents such as the BMW 340i and Volvo S60 Polestar which are both quicker off the mark. But then the Lexus has an ace up its sleeve &#x2013; it is less expensive than both of these and, in this segment, price is a key factor. The F Sport serves up a comfortable, spacious travel environment and the ride quality is creamy smooth. Factor in a sporty flip-side and zesty looks and it becomes an attractive alternative to the German badges so much favoured by status conscious South Africans. The Lexus IS 350 is priced at R728,800 that includes a four-year/100,000 Service plan.
