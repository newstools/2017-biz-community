The terminal recently received railed cargo for the first time in almost four years and is the result of a six-month project to revitalise these facilities between Barloworld Logistics and Newlyn Properties. To date, some 36,500 tonnes of AMSA products have been received at the terminal and warehouse. &#x201c;This initiative is the result of a successful collaborative effort between four key players, each leader in their respective sectors, combined with AMSA&#x2019;s willingness to take the first step,&#x201d; says Mathys Enslin, managing executive at Barloworld Logistics. Benefits Through the implementation of well-managed rail supply chain solutions, cargo is converted from road to rail, service delivery is enhanced and the time to market is significantly reduced. In addition, carbon emissions and road congestion around the key industrial locations is dramatically decreased. With the Elandsfontein Intermodal Terminal now fully operational, the annual rail delivery of some 700,000 tonnes of AMSA products from various production plants will ultimately result in the reduction of over 42,000 long-haul road vehicle movements. &#x201c;While there are numerous cost benefits to all stakeholders, arguably the most important benefit is the fact that we are making South Africa more competitive by enhancing and developing the nation&#x2019;s freight system,&#x201d; says Enslin. Barloworld Logistics has partnered with TFR over the past few years to create effective solutions in converting road volumes to rail. &#x201c;We are proud to be a part of such transformative projects and look forward to achieving a lot more, in collaboration with smart partners such as AMSA, TFR and Newlyn Properties,&#x201d; adds Enslin. &#x201c;We are all very closely aligned with regards to our vision for and commitment to South Africa&#x2019;s economic and industrial development.&#x201d;
