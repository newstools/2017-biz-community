The wine popsicles, created and developed by JML Consulting, were initially launched in 26 Pick n Pay stores and by the end of December were available in 38 stores across Gauteng, KZN, Limpopo and the Western Cape. Natasha Alomia, director of JML Consulting, explains that the Pierre Jourdan Wine Popsicles &#x2013; or PJ Pops &#x2013; took 13 months of planning, conceptualising and hard work to develop, with the end result being the birth of a new and successful product category in the country. &#x201c;Launching a new brand in what would be considered a luxury item category was not something we did lightly, given the current tight economic times,&#x201d; says Alomia. &#x201c;An extensive amount of research went into the PJ Pops &#x2013; not to mention sleepless nights &#x2013; as we honed the design, production and ultimately the end product into something which we are very pleased to report has garnered the South African public&#x2019;s full support. Evident in the phenomenal sales figures achieved in such a short time.&#x201d; &#x201c;The success of PJ Pops is also attributable to partnering with the acclaimed Franschhoek Haute Cabri re, the home of Pierre Jourdan, and national retailer Pick n Pay who both shared our innovative vision.&#x201d; Alomia says that they did experience their fair share of challenges and occasional set-backs during the development and launch of PJ Pops, however, six months post-launch and the company says it sees ongoing potential in the market for the product. Three new flavours are currently in development for release this year and there are negotiations in place with other retailers, both in South Africa and internationally, to stock the popsicles. Jon-Marc De Carvalho, co-director of JML Consulting also hints at the launch of another popsicle product to be launched later in the year which he says will "not only be a South African first but a world first in this newly developed market category".
