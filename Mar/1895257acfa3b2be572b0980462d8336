During the South African Wedding Inspirations-sponsored show on both days of The Wedding Expo, beautiful gowns from recent magazine fashion shoots will grace the ramp, bringing the pages of the magazine to life in front of the enthusiastic Wedding Expo crowd. The twice-daily fashion show is one of the major drawcards of this highly popular expo. The fashion show will showcase a range of gorgeous gowns that have been featured in the magazine, highlighting the work of amazingly talented local designers as well as a wonderfully diverse selection of tailored ready-to-wear international ranges available through experienced local retailers. Trends such as lace embellishment, illusion necklines, long sleeves, coloured gowns and ballgown skirts will all make their mark on the fashion ramp during the fashion show. &#x201c;We are delighted to be partnering with The Wedding Expo to give our readers and followers an immersive live-action magazine experience. It&#x2019;s thrilling for us to be able to showcase the very talented local designers and international retailers who form the backbone of our fashion pages,&#x201d; says South African Wedding Inspirations editor Julia Boltt. Readers will also be able to snap up the brand new issue of South African Wedding Inspirations for an Expo-exclusive price, available only at The Wedding Expo on 11 and 12 March.
