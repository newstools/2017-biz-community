&#x2018;Simon' is the latest brand TV commercial produced by +27 Advertising and Bouffant on behalf of Discovery Insure. The commercial was shot over two days in the Johannesburg CBD. It's a tongue&#x2013;in&#x2013;cheek look at celebrity culture, and features the likes of sporting celebrities Victor Matfield and Chad le Clos. &#x201c;The premise of this commercial is to promote the appealing proposition that Discovery Insure celebrates and rewards good driving behaviour,&#x201d; says Adrian Miller, agency co-founder and executive creative director. He added, &#x201c;We crafted an elaborate production to showcase a visual feast of interestingness aimed at entertaining, engaging and inspiring action from viewers. The spot exudes the excitement felt by Simon's fans and intends to evoke expression through a smile and/or a little chuckle.&#x201d; Crowds of fans are shown admiring and cheering for Simon as he drives through the city. There's even a helicopter tracking him along his route. Simon is later revealed as &#x2018;The World's Best Driver' with huge fanfare; experiencing red carpet treatment, even attracting the attention of one of South Africa's famous and highly regarded sports icons, Chad le Clos. Discovery Insure offers rewards for good driving with up to 50% of their members BP and Shell fuel expenditure back every month. Members also get up to 15% off Tiger Wheel and Tyre purchases, as well as up to 25% off Uber rides to name but a few rewards. They also provide regular feedback to help drivers improve their driving. Agency managing partner and co-founder Prenneven Govender expressed: &#x201c;+27 Advertising is a full-service, integrated advertising agency that builds brands. We thrive on leveraging our team's combined experience, insights and ideas to breathe life into a brand's ethos, thereby creating interesting work that that gets spoken about, played with and shared in the marketplace.
