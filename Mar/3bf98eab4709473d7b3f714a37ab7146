Kenya Kenya is a co-host to the great wildebeest migration, one of the &#x2018;seven natural wonders of the world&#x2019;. The Masai Mara in Kenya, together with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, provide a magical stage from July to November as over two million wildebeest and other wildlife migrate from the Serengeti to the Mara. It is captivating to watch the shifting columns of herds attempt to cross the Mara River that is infested with Nile crocodiles. Termed the greatest show on earth, it is an exhilarating drama on a truly phenomenal scale. A Kenya safari is something not to be missed. There's definite pecking order at the ol Donyo waterhole. The elephant bulls rule entirely. #oldonyo #kenyasafari #oldonyowaterhole #bigtusker A post shared by Great Plains Conservation (@greatplainsconservation) on Sep 13, 2016 at 4:53am PDT Tanzania Apart from co-hosting the greatest wildebeest migration, Tanzania is home to one of the largest concentrations of animals in Africa as well as the game-rich Serengeti National Park. With vast landscapes hosting diverse animals and a calm and stable atmosphere, you'll feel connected to the land from the moment you first arrive. It is also one of the few places where you can see chimpanzees up close in their habitat near Lake Tanganyika. Photography by @wolfography " The pure volume of wildlife in Tanzania was simply incredible. But nothing compared to the Great Migration in the northern Serengeti, where we witnessed the famed River Crossings. Witnessing the massive herds of Wildebeests crossing the Mara River was equally nerve racking as it was entertaining. The herds are extremely cautious as they approach the river filled with crocs, but all it takes is one brave soul then the herd follows! #serengeti #Tanzania A post shared by serengeti national park (@serengeti_national_park) on Nov 4, 2016 at 6:31am PDT South Africa South Africa is a dream safari destination largely in part because of Kruger National Park. It is one of the world's greatest national parks with unspoiled beauty, filled with all the iconic safari species and a great diversity of flora. Get ready to experience nearly two million hectares of bush plains filled with striking landscapes and wildlife that cause the frozen images in magazines to spring to life.

The wealth of wildlife that you can see in Botswana is incomprehensible - massive herds of elephant, numerous lion prides and home to all the members of the Big Five species. If you&#x2019;re looking for a reliable safari destination - then Botswana is the one for you. The best way to explore the #okavangodelta - on a #mokoro .. This is #africa at its best! #safari #machabasafaris #GomotiPlains #twinproptour A post shared by Gareth (@gam.box) on Mar 14, 2017 at 1:49am PDT Namibia Namibia is home to a quarter of the global cheetah population and the last free-roaming black rhinos in the world. Black rhinos are gentle herbivore giants that are non-violent and are critically endangered. Watching them traverse the African Savannah uprooting shrubs and chewing cud is a quintessential experience. Etosha National Park is another location filled with sheer wonder and a wealth of attractions. The abundance of game, dramatic landscapes and diverse bird species make it a magical place to visit. The chase is on! You need patience to get shots like these. It took around two hours of waiting to capture this image at Salvadora waterhole - many other vehicles would drive in, look around - ah, just some lions sleeping in the grass - and then drive off to find some action, but look what they missed!
