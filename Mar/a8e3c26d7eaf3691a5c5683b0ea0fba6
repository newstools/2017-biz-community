From the moment that guests step through the hotel doors, they will be welcomed into the revamped reception and lounge areas, boasting brand new furniture, fittings and d cor. Both the Promenade Restaurant and the hotel&#x2019;s sundowner sipping spot, the Promenade Cocktail Bar, will be undergoing a total refurbishment with a new layout, bar and a contemporary earthy feel creating an elegant environment in which diners can enjoy a palate-pleasing experience. The cosy &#x201c;Sofie&#x2019;s Lounge&#x201d; and the hotel&#x2019;s three conference venues will also undergo redecoration with new softs and furnishings. What&#x2019;s more, the hotel&#x2019;s 130 rooms, which command spectacular views of either the Atlantic Ocean or world-famous Table Mountain, will be treated to an aesthetic upgrade, with new softs, continuing the contemporary earthy theme to complement the overall ambiance of the hotel. To accommodate the refurbishments, the main hotel wing will be closed from June to end of July 2017. However, the recently renovated East Wing will still be available for booking on a room-only basis. A temporary reception desk will be set up in this section of the hotel during these months. Over this time, food and beverage services will be suspended and the conference rooms, business centre, and library will be inaccessible. During the renovations, access to certain areas of the hotel may be periodically restricted in order to complete the various stages of the project. The hotel&#x2019;s facilities such as on-site parking, free Wi-Fi and complimentary shuttle to the V&A Waterfront, will still be on offer, although these may be limited at certain times. &#x201c;We will be investing in excess of R11 million to improve the overall guest experience and are eager to share the new-look Premier Hotel Cape Town in September,&#x201d; says Managing Director of Premier Hotels & Resorts, Samuel Nassimov. Cape Town-based Betts Townsend Construction has been selected as the project management company to work on the refurbishment under Nassimov&#x2019;s guidance.
