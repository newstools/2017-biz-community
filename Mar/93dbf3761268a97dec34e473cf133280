Inspired by the versatility of Velvet, the #funfilledvelvet campaign encourages people to purchase, experiment and share their Velvet creation. The campaign&#x2019;s creative execution centres around a visual (below) where you can see what Velvet can make, &#x201c;We wanted to showcase the culinary potential of the product can, a beautiful 3D render image will appear across all touchpoints,&#x201d; comments Boomtown Account Manager Jess Massyn. Product indicators, eye-catchers and banner ads will be used in Pick n Pay and Checkers stores nationwide, with sampling stations at selected Checkers Hypers where consumers can take part in fun sampling activities. &#x201c;Shoppers will be given a mini donut hole to dip in their Velvet flavour of choice, and then add fun toppings. This showcases the fun element of the product as well as getting consumers to taste the product,&#x201d; adds Massyn. Using the Snap n Save app, consumers will also be able to save R7 on purchases of Velvet during the campaign. The social media element will include creative engaging content and a competition. When home cooks have made their own decadent creation, if they name it and share on Facebook using #funfilledvelvet, they stand the chance to win one of five decadent First Choice Velvet dessert tables to the value of R5000 each.
