The team, led by CEO Harish Goyal, also took time to talk to grade 12 students and inspire them with a vision for future opportunities. Goyal noted, &#x201c;It was time well invested with young scholars of impressionable minds, educating them on the various career options available within the media and broadcast space. You could visibly see how excited these learners were at the thought of expanding their horizons.&#x201d; Zee Africa also embraced the Tembisa Community Hospital under its wing. The hospital, in the previously disadvantaged township of Tembisa, Johannesburg, was in dire need of upgraded facilities and Zee stepped in to assist with this, in addition to sponsoring medical equipment for its surgical wing. These projects were done in collaboration with the SA Medical and Education Foundation (SAME), which has identified facilities in underprivileged communities that need urgent assistance. The SAME Foundation is a national non-profit organisation, specialising in the upliftment of communities through strategic projects in the health and education sectors.
