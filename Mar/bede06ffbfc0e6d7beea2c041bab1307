What began as a public invitation by M-Net for aspiring actors to send in audition videos of themselves acting out scenes from their favourite movies, resulted in over 550 entries from all over the country. The Spitfire directors then had to whittle these down to 20 finalists, and then to six competition winners after an additional &#x201c;live&#x201d; audition process with the directors. In the meantime, a professional scriptwriter was hard at work weaving the 10 parody movie scenes together. Then the actual shooting began. Shot over five extremely long days, on nine main locations and with three side locations, the Spitfire directors worked with two crews simultaneously to make sure that every great scene was captured beautifully. Together with the winners, the cast comprised professional actors along with a healthy dose of Spitfire staff for background stand-ins, which called for sharp and agile directing &#x2013; exactly what Spitfire is famous for. A professionalism highlighted in the collaborative way AK, Peter and Akin worked together under extreme conditions. Cue genius cinematography from DOPs Rob Wilson and Dino Benedetti, and some nifty organisational skills from Producer Cherice Whewell and Executive Producer Liesl Karpinski and the result is a 27-minute-long movie guaranteed to entertain your socks off. Now imagine what we can do for your script.
