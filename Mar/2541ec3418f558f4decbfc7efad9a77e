If you&#x2019;re a business executive and you&#x2019;re feeling this way, you probably have a few questions. It&#x2019;s likely that you&#x2019;re wondering which channels you should invest in to get the highest return? And questioning how you can grow your customer base in the most cost-effective way possible? Perhaps you&#x2019;re also debating where you can find customers that&#x2019;ll be interested in what you have to offer? John Wanamaker, a well-known political figure and marketing pioneer is credited with originally saying: &#x201c;Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half&#x201d;. But with the right solution this needn&#x2019;t be the case. And that&#x2019;s where Analytical Market Optimisation or AMO&#x2122; from Effective Intelligence (EI) comes in.
