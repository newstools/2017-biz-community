Each video shot for a day and we travelled to Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg to showcase the three cities and three different stories ranging from photography, sock design and traditional Zulu beading. It&#x2019;s always great to see the immediate reactions from viewers on social media platforms and we believe we did not disappoint. But let&#x2019;s not lie, we also love some international recognition and we are literally doing backflips about winning silver (for content editing) at CICLOPE 2016 (the festival of craft). Being nominated alongside companies such as Smuggler and Prettybird sure ain't bad. Have a look - we hope they make you happy.
