Briefed to come up with an interior scheme for a new Piza e Vino outlet within the newly added extension to the Lynnridge Mall in Lynnwood, Pretoria, Inhouse Brand Architects was responsible for establishing Piza e Vino and its brand in the new space, working with the architects and construction team from the ground up. Inhouse took inspiration for the project from a diversity of vintage influences, particularly old-school pizzerias. Nostalgia plays a role in the restaurant&#x2019;s finishes, which are a blend of patterned and subway tiles, polished concrete flooring, light oak dining tables, light coloured marble counter tops, real leather upholstered booths, leather seating with brass buckles and strapping details, and reclaimed timber cladding. 'Handmade' concept In addition to the sense of nostalgia, the concept of 'handmade' was critical in the design scheme. This concept is reinforced by the choice to place a completely open kitchen in the heart of the space. A grand, custom-designed pizza oven is the focal point, here. The oven is large and hexagonal, tiled in geometrics, and quietly dominates any view of the restaurant. The oven is fronted by a pizza bar where diners can take in a 'master class' of the chefs at work and children can create their own pizzas. Just beyond the kitchen, a custom-built steel screen encompasses the central booth seating. The room divider is adorned with over 100 wooden rolling pins, paying tribute to the craft of hand-rolled pizza dough. The lighting further accentuates the handmade inspiration and authenticity of the space. Glass blown pendants with brass fittings and vintage wall sconces with amber tinted glass generate a welcoming, intimate atmosphere. The finished look aims to give life to the brand, creating the sense of a traditional, rustic pizzeria in the heart of Pretoria. Piza e Vino falls under the Doppio Zero Group.
