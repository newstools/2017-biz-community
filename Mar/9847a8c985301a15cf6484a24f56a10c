 georgejmclittle via 123RFKevin Tucker, founder of PriceCheck, notes that the company's recent user survey identified &#x2018;ease and efficiency&#x2019; as South African&#x2019;s most-liked aspect of online shopping (53%). This was followed by access to deals and the opportunity to purchase international products and brands. &#x201c;58% of respondents shopped online when they spotted a good deal on offer. Not only does this suggest that online shopping fulfils consumers&#x2019; wants ahead of their needs but it also reveals the nature of local consumers to compare prices across retailers and etailers, before making a purchase. &#x201c;Having shared their reasons for choosing to shop online, 95% of respondents further stated that they would continue to shop online moving forward. Only 15 respondents, which does not even amount to 1%, said they would no longer shop online, with 5% uncertain of whether they would do so again. &#x201c;Such positive feedback suggests that many first-time shoppers will be shopping online again in the future and may become regular e-commerce customers. In addition, as consumers are presented with more e-commerce offerings and brick and mortar stores join in - having found easier access to trading online through umbrella platforms such as PriceCheck Marketplace &#x2013; online shopping numbers are likely to continue on an upward trend.&#x201d; In terms of safety, 78% of those surveyed noted that they feel safe using their credit card online. &#x201c;This plays a major role in consumer participation and is a good reflection of the efforts made by the industry in utilising secure payment options. Most online users &#x2013; 55% &#x2013; opt for debit card payments. However, portals such as PayPal and SnapScan have gained the trust of many with 21% and 13% of respondents selecting these options respectively. &#x201c;The delivery time of orders is a major influencer when it comes to which etailers consumers favour. South Africans are likely to choose local suppliers with the quickest delivery record. Local is lekker &#x201c;Most respondents preferred to shop locally or both locally and internationally. When South African online shoppers do choose to shop internationally, they tend to prefer the US (49%) and the UK (27%). &#x201c;Overall, shopping locally online came out on top &#x2013; 47% and 41% of respondents rated their local online shopping experience four out of five and five out of five stars respectively. This is compared to 44% and 31% for international online shopping experiences, within the same rating categories. &#x201c;While South Africa may have been slow on the initial uptake of online shopping, current consumer behaviour &#x2013; as presented through our findings &#x2013; suggests that the efficiency and convenience provided by e-commerce platforms will soon result in this option being just as common within our communities as traditional shopping trips are today,&#x201d; Tucker concludes.
