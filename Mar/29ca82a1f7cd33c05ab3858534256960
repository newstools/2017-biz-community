Black Insomnia Co&#xfb00;ee is the brainchild of founder Sean Kristafor, who had a vision of &#x2018;rebooting&#x2019; the co&#xfb00;ee industry. According to Kristafor, &#x201c;It is time to o&#xfb00;er something a little di&#xfb00;erent &#x2013; something stronger and darker, with an edge.&#x201d; After experimenting in the company&#x2019;s lab, Kristafor and one of the world&#x2019;s foremost roasters, Dr G (Gerald Charles), managed to roast up a blend of beans that produced an indulgent smooth sweet nutty &#xfb02;avour, which the company says trumps other co&#xfb00;ees trying to make the same claim. Black Insomnia is pure and naturally very high in ca&#xfb00;eine without any added chemicals, preservatives, sugars or any other additives. Laboratory test results, using the high-performance liquid chromatography method, have found that this amounts to 17,524 mg of ca&#xfb00;eine per kg. Compared to the 13,179 mg of ca&#xfb00;eine per kg in Deathwish Co&#xfb00;ee, Black Insomnia is 33% stronger. The International ca&#xfb00;eine reference website, the Ca&#xfb00;eine Informer, has now accredited Black Insomnia as &#x2018;the world&#x2019;s strongest co&#xfb00;ee&#x2019;. This is not to say that co&#xfb00;ee cannot have higher ca&#xfb00;eine content, whether natural or arti&#xfb01;cial, but rather that it should not. This is motivated by two primary reasons, of which public health and safety are &#xfb01;rst and foremost. According to Mayo Clinic, &#x201c;Up to 400 mg [equivalent to 6 mg/kg body weight in a 65-kg person] of ca&#xfb00;eine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults. That is roughly the amount of ca&#xfb00;eine in four [170 ml] cups of brewed co&#xfb00;ee.&#x201d; Thus, having just one 170 ml cup of Black Insomnia almost ful&#xfb01;ls the recommended maximum intake. According to Kristafor, during their experimental phase, &#x201c;Any blend that resulted in a higher ca&#xfb00;eine content than 702 mg adversely a&#xfb00;ected the &#xfb02;avour and thus was rejected.&#x201d;
