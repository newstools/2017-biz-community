Focusing on the world&#x2019;s leading brands, including Santa Cruz, Juliana and Maxxis, RushSports was established in 2005, and is fast becoming a leading distributor in Africa with ambitions in developing markets. This move comes after the company, which is headed up by respected cyclists and entrepreneurs Andre van Aarde and Brandon Els, have brought onboard legendary, three-time downhill mountain bike, world champ, and Santa Cruz rider Greg Minnaar, as a director. Els comments on moving the RushSports stable of brands to Boomtown, saying: &#x201c;RushSports has moved its head office to Port Elizabeth recently, and like us, Boomtown is based in the city and has a national reputation,&#x201d; remarks Els. &#x201c;Its international awards attracted us to the agency, but the most important reason is that Andrew MacKenzie who heads up the agency is a committed mountain biker who regularly races endurance events and understands the market and environment that we operate in. No other agency in South Africa would be able to offer this combination.&#x201d; Within the brief given to Boomtown, the agency will be working not only on the tier one global brands of RushSports, but also on the creation of exciting new brands which will focus on affordable quality products. &#x201c;We have many keen cyclists in the agency, so as well as the ability to uncover consumer insights we can speak from experience,&#x201d; remarks Boomtown MD, Andrew MacKenzie. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re excited to be working with such an energetic company that is going places &#x2013; fast.&#x201d;
