Tips to make the most of your sips:Arrive early &#x2013; More time to taste the wines you&#x2019;re interested in before venues fill up. Put on your wine walking shoes &#x2013; Comfort is key, and that step count means tastings are guilt-free. Book for supper &#x2013; Tastings close at 9pm but venues remain open thereafter. Be sure to book for some supper at your favourite Parkhurst spot. Mix it up a little &#x2013; The map is a mere guideline, visit the #JoziWineRoute venues as you please. Prepare to buy some wine &#x2013; You might find your favourite at Dry Dock Liquors. Find the wine fairies &#x2013; If you&#x2019;re lost, they&#x2019;ll be able to show you around. Get tatted &#x2013; Find your wild wine side. Werner and Mash are on hand with free wine inspired temporary tatoos.</li></li></li></li></li></li> Want to be a bit more in the know?
