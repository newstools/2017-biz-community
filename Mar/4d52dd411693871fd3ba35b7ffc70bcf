"At BON Hotels wanted to do things a little differently. We wanted to make our guests, loyal followers and &#x201c;real people&#x201d; (as opposed to unreal) our ambassadors. We wanted to make certain that we chose people who represent our brand perfectly. Cool people, who would be happy to promote us, like share and click, speak about us at the braai and make all their friends a little envious. So, we took it to the social media pages and launched our #BONHomie competition that invited our followers to enter to stand a chance of becoming one of our very own ambassadors, our BONHomies. What we also did was decide to throw a celebrity into the group too - no ordinary celeb though: we looked for the outstanding ones, who matched our ethos of Good people; Good thinking; Good feeling." Let the homies speak for themselves: Mia de Klerk BONhomies Mia de Klerk (BON Hotel Swakopmund) "Being a BONhomie allows me to be part of a very interesting group of people. Real people who are fun and who are looking for a unique experience and comfortable stay when choosing their hotel. The BONHomie movement means you are part of a very special family - good people who share the joy of having found a very special home away from home." Kedidimetse TswaiKedidimetse Tswai (Mrs Africa 2017) &#x201c;A place I call home away from home. BonHomie creates a platform to communicate and learn from others irrespective of color, race, age and status." Why I love representing the brand? "A brand that understands a customer." "Good service for good rates." "Bonding, friendship and laughter." Lerato Manjiya (BON Hotel Bloemfontein Central) "A place to meet good people, to have good food and enjoy the excellent service. I love being a BONhomie and representing the brand because it&#x2019;s a place where you feel home - it cares about the community, they never turn anybody away."
