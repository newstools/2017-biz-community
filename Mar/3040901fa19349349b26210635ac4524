Apple Music featured the music video in France, Germany, the UK and the US, something that almost never happens to African videos. Apple Music hailed its &#x201c;audacious visuals,&#x201d; describing it as &#x201c;epic&#x201d; and &#x201c;stunning.&#x201d; The music video also contributed to Nasty C&#x2019;s track, Don&#x2019;t Do It, being played on Beats 1&#x2019;s flagship hip hop show with Ebro. &#x201c;From New York City to South Africa, hip-hop&#x2019;s global reach is amazing,&#x201d; said Ebro. &#x201c;At the helm, we have young cats like Nasty C pushing the culture forward both musically and visually." The music video includes three songs from the Metro FM winner&#x2019;s Bad Hair Extensions album: Don&#x2019;t Do It, Phases and Good Girls and Snapchat Hoes. The #Veliswa premiere screening sold out Ster-Kinekor cinemas in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg, trending on Twitter. &#x201c;Nasty C approached me to direct a film featuring three of his songs, that would make a statement,&#x201d; says Kyle. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an art piece about his own journey of breaking free and becoming a man, with the three sections representing the past, present and future respectively. Visually, the films move further and further away from the initial renaissance styling, as a visual metaphor for breaking way from the ideals of the past and becoming true to yourself. As surreal as it gets, I tried to keep it as real and visceral as possible, which is what I got from Nasty&#x2019;s music.&#x201c; Pierre De Villiers shot the music video, which was styled by Kaley Meyer, art directed by Bianca Prinsloo, and edited by Stephen du Plessis.
