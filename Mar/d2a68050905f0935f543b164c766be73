@ymgerman via 123RF - Australia, Gold CoastBrand South Africa will address expatriate South Africans at two media dinners - in Sydney on 7 March 2017 and Melbourne on 9 March 2017 - in an effort to persuade South Africans living in Australia to promote South Africa as a desirable destination for investment and tourism. Research conducted by Brand South Africa in 2015 indicated that South Africans living in Australia are some of the most negative about the country. Says Brand South Africa&#x2019;s CEO Dr Kingsley Makhubela: &#x201c;Brand SA has returned to Australia to respond to some of the issues raised by the research in 2015. During the visit, we will provide updated information and feedback on the performance of South Africa domestically and internationally. &#x201c;South Africans living abroad are one of the most important constituencies because of their ability to promote and profile the country positively can be encouraged to fly the South African flag and we&#x2019;re hoping that our visit will persuade South African expatriates to contribute to collective efforts promote South Africa as a globally competitive business and tourist destination.&#x201d; Limpho Monyamane of the Nelson Mandela Foundation is part of Brand South Africa&#x2019;s delegation to Australia. The Nelson Mandela Foundation aims to contribute to a just and prosperous society in South Africa by emulating the legacy of South Africa&#x2019;s great statesman and first president of a democratic South Africa, Nelson Mandela. &#x201c;As part of the engagements in Sydney and Melbourne, Brand South Africa will share an analysis of the performance of South Africa. Through this process it is anticipated that Global South Africans can be encouraged to fly the South African flag and, therefore, contribute to collective efforts to promote South Africa as a globally competitive business and tourist destination,&#x201d; says Dr Makhubela.
