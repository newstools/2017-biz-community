Spree was presented with an e-commerce site bronze pixel at the Bookmarks Awards. As a result this GIF is a good representation of how their team is currently feeling. Hawkins adds, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fantastic to see the Bookmarks Awards not only recognising agencies, but also publishers and brands." She also feels there is a lot of exceptional digital work at the moment, which is why they couldn&#x2019;t be prouder to be amongst the winners on the night, while also consistently being recognised in the category of e-commerce sites, year after year.
