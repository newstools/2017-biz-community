Momentum will increase NAAMSA continued to anticipate that the momentum in vehicle exports would increase over the medium term. Domestically, key indicators such as the latest Purchasing Managers&#x2019; Index (PMI) and the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s leading indicator &#x2013; which had recorded an extraordinary improvement for five consecutive months &#x2013; heralded the possibility of an improvement in South Africa&#x2019;s medium term economic outlook. In addition, the easing of drought conditions and projected global economic growth of around 3.4% as well as continuing Rand strength which should benefit new vehicle pricing &#x2013; represented factors which should contribute positively to sales of new motor vehicles over the medium term. Export sales were expected to benefit from the projected improvement in global economic conditions. Based on the improvement in key economic indicators, NAAMSA continued to anticipate that 2017 aggregate annual domestic sales volumes would improve modestly by around 3.5% in volume terms.
