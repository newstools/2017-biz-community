Speaking at the launch, executive director Andrew Teixeira said that Louwlardia was part of the 1-million square metre of warehousing that is due to be developed by Fortress over the next five years. This equates to a combined investment of an estimated R8bn in South Africa&#x2019;s logistics sector during that period. Louwlardia Logistics Park artist impression Louwlardia, which will see approximately 90,000m2 of warehousing developed on the 16,7ha site, is expected to be completed within the next 24 months. The first phase, which comprises a 21,785m2 warehouse with 1,843m2 offices, is complete and ready for occupancy. High tech design Fortress Income Fund executive director Andrew Teixeira&#x201c;In a tough economy where cost containment and efficiency are king, we are actually providing A-grade logistics at a lower cost. With properties that offer high tech design that includes the likes of solar and natural light to reduce power consumption, strategic locations that make for more efficient distribution and properties that provide easy access and better turnaround times, we are effectively lowering the cost per pallet,&#x201d; Teixeira explained. The newly launched warehouse at Louwlardia has a height of 13,5m to the underside of the eaves which offers efficiencies of scale and an FM2 floor which provides a solid platform for the erection of racking and easy movement of mechanised machinery with a 38m yard. Green building best practice is incorporated via features such as low maintenance indigenous landscaping that is fully irrigated and buildings that can accommodate photo voltaic cells for the production of electricity.
