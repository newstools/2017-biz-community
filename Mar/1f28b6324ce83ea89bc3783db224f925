SURRENDER from goldenplanes.com on Vimeo.Barnwell joined FCB Cape Town in March 2012 after returning to South Africa from his Auckland-based post as executive creative director of Publicis Mojo New Zealand. A year after his arrival in Cape Town, FCB CT enjoyed their best creative awards haul ever picking up numerous accolades including their first ever Loeries Grand Prix and Creative Circle Ad of the Year. A result, which helped, propels the FCB Group to 3rd overall on the local creative table. He has been a juror at the Cannes Awards, D&AD, The Clio Awards, The London International Awards and the local Loeries numerous times and currently sits on the FCB Global Creative Council. "Surrender is a wonderful piece of storytelling that had me completely captivated for the full 6.31mins. Actually, 13.02mins seeing as I ended up watching it twice. An amazing feat in itself considering I generally have the attention span of a goldfish with ADD," said Barnwell. "What really kept me glued from beginning to end though was the incredibly authentic delivery of Milton&#x2019;s testimonial. At no point did I feel like I was listening to someone reading from an overly crafted script. "Visually, I also loved the restraint the director showed by holding himself back from deploying the usual visual gimmickry normally associated with a retrospective story. No gratuitous flashbacks and no over-the-top performances all make this piece feel so pure and honest. I&#x2019;m still not sure whether the film is fact or fiction. Storytelling at its best. Well done Porteus Xandau." Special mentions for the month also went to:DebtBusters Numbers directed by Bruno Bossi at Carbon Films.
