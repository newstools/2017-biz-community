Defying easy categorisation of their crossover multi-genre sounds, The Internet was christened as a result of the two producers &#x2013; Syd (Sydney) and Matt Martians (real name Matthew Martins) - meeting on the net, then officially forming the band in 2011. They have since released three studio albums and three extended plays, with Ego Death nominated for a Grammy &#x2013; Best Urban Contemporary Album. Of Ego Death Pitchfork contributor Craig Jenkins remarked that: &#x201c;The band's purposeful instrumentation clears room to showcase her [Syd] words, and she has a war story for every stage of love and loss.&#x201d; Festival Director Billy Domingo says of their inclusion in the 2017 CTIJF line-up: &#x201c;We are excited to welcome The Internet to South Africa. Their fresh sound and insightful lyrics both inform and entertain and they are certain to appeal and resonate with a diverse audience. The band is the perfect addition to this socially conscious 2017 musical line-up.&#x201d; Catch The Internet on the Manenberg Stage on Saturday, 1 April 2017, at the Cape Town International Jazz Festival happening 31 March and 1 April 2017.
