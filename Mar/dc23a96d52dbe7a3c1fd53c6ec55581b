Christopher Kane's Crocs and Prada's Teva style sandal.According to the trendsetters over at Vogue, 1990s nostalgia has brought back the popularity of the unfashionable fashion shoe, also known as the &#x2018;pretty ugly&#x2019; shoe. The four &#x2018;pretty ugly&#x2019; shoes of 90s nostalgia Vogue narrowed down the &#x2018;pretty ugly&#x2019; shoe to the Birkenstock, the pool slide, the Teva-style sandal and the clog. The trend has since gone on to include lots more including Crocs as well as Uggs and even a Teva-Ugg. The fashion-forward all over have been embracing it and it&#x2019;s been making its appearance in all walks of fashion (catwalks, sidewalks). During London Fashion Week, models sported bejeweled Crocs in the Christopher Kane spring/summer 2017 ready-to-wear collection, 2014 CFDA Fashion Icon, Rihanna included fuzzy and bow pool sliders in her Puma x Fenty collection and &#x2018;banal eccentricity&#x2019; leader, Miuccia Prada showed off Prada&#x2019;s Teva style sandal at the Miu Miu spring/summer 2017 RTW show. Unexpect it. Go looking for it. #Nomad #Prada365 #PradaExits #PradaSS17 A post shared by Prada (@prada) on Jan 8, 2017 at 9:01am PST Much like incorporating pyjamas and athleisure into everyday attire, this trend allows you to attempt a look that doesn&#x2019;t favour fashion over comfort. So, if you&#x2019;re looking to give it a go, Who What Wear suggests that you pair your &#x2018;pretty ugly&#x2019; shoe with &#x2018;eccentric&#x2019; pieces like a brightly coloured jumper or printed overalls.
