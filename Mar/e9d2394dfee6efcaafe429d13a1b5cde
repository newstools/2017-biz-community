The retailer said this was a logical step after it moved the head office of David Jones in Sydney and the Country Road Group head office in Melbourne to a single campus based in Richmond, Melbourne. It has promoted John Dixon &#x2013; a former executive of UK retailer Marks & Spencer who was appointed David Jones CEO in 2015 &#x2013; to WHL Australasia CEO from September. Friday's statement did not mention Scott Fyfe, who was appointed Country Road CEO in September 2016. The Australian newspaper reported on Friday: "As part of the restructure Sacha Laing, chief operating officer of Country Road Group, will be leaving the business with immediate effect. Country Road Group has gone through a number of executive upheavals over the last few years following the sudden departure of two of its CEs &#x2013; Matt Keogh and, before him, Iain Nairn." Woolworths CEO Ian Moir said in the statement: "The creation of a single regional structure is the logical next step for our business. It enables the benefits and synergies of the Australian acquisitions to be fully realised and allows the creation of a single team and culture focused on our Australian customers and driving improved shareholder returns for the WHL Group." Woolworths said the consolidation would not result in job cuts. It expected the combined 1,300 employees in the new head office to grow to about 1,500. Source: BDpro
