 Rancz Andrei via 123RFSpeaking in a recent interview, Lezanne Botha, a senior specialist for the Insurance Regulatory Framework department at the FSB said, &#x201c;There is existing consumer-protection legislation in place in the form of the Consumer Protection Act. But it is important to bear in mind that the Consumer Protection Act does not apply to insurers. &#x201c;It can be said that financial services industries should be held to a higher standard of consumer protection than other industries, because of the risks and the failures in that these products can actually impose considerable hardships for consumers.&#x201d; When the new regulations come into effect, estimated to be June 2017, the South African insurance industry will be in-line with international standards. &#x201c;This is good news for consumers,&#x201d; remarks SMSPortal MD, Charles Stretch. &#x201c;The CPA protects consumers against unwanted SMS but currently there is nothing to stop insurance companies sending unwanted direct marketing.&#x201d; Draft wording The draft states: &#x2022; 13.10 Unwanted direct marketing &#x2022; 13.10.1 An insurer or any person acting on its behalf must afford a policyholder to whom it markets a policy through a mobile phone voice or text message the right to demand during or within a reasonable time after the message that the insurer or person acting on its behalf desist from initiating any such further messages or any other communication. &#x2022; 13.10.2 An insurer or any person acting on its behalf may not charge a policyholder a fee or allow a mobile phone service provider to charge a policyholder any fee for making a demand in terms of 13.10.1. Upon implementation, all insurers will need to send SMS communication from a reverse billed number. &#x201c;This means when consumers reply 'STOP' to an unwanted SMS the sender of the initial SMS, in this case the insurance company, is charged for the SMS, not the consumer,&#x201d; advises Stretch. Botha in her interview added, &#x201c;Until the effective date, if a policyholder gets these calls or SMSs they have to be afforded &#x2013; by the insurer or the person contacting them on behalf of the insurer &#x2013; the right to opt out. So, if you received a mobile phone voice message or a text message, the insurer has to afford you the right to demand, during or within a reasonable time after receiving such a message, that they must desist from any further marketing messages. They may also not charge you for making use of that right.&#x201d; It is easy for pay-as-you-go mobile subscribers and those without itemised billing to be unaware of the charge being applied to their account. Until the PPR are in place, consumers might see a charge on their bill to opt-out of unwanted insurer communication, but post implementation consumers should not see a charge. &#x201c;If you have been wrongfully charged or would like to seek advice, consumers should speak to WASPA, the Wireless Application Service Providers Association,&#x201d; concludes Stretch.
