&#x201c;As with each whisky in the N durra range, it is produced using authentic 19th Century methods. A limited quantity is available because of the extensive time and craftsmanship involved in its making. Significantly, N durra Peated marks the first time since the 19th century, that The Glenlivet has released a peated whisky,&#x201d; says The Glenlivet brand manager, Eugene Lenford. Bottled at 61.5% ABV Cask Strength / 48% ABV, the N durra Peated Whisky Cask Finish is inspired by the authentic production processes used at The Glenlivet Distillery by its founder, George Smith, who originally used peat smoke to dry the malted barley. Finished in peated casks, the classic, smooth and fruity house style has been enriched with gentle, aromatic smoky notes. The latest release is presented in redesigned packaging, which includes a prominent batch number, cask-like stamps and a more visible translation of the Gaelic word, 'N durra' &#x2013; meaning natural. The Glenlivet N durra Peated Whisky Cask Finish is available from selected stores countrywide from March 2017 onwards at an approximate retail price of R818.92 &#x2013; the same price as N durra First Fill and N durra Oloroso.
