BoytjieThe journey of Die Lady, Boertjie and Boytjie, spanned over 443, 557 kilometres and saw over 12,000 bales of hay weighing 3,456 tonnes delivered to farmers that were affected by the drought. The facilitation of the deliveries to the farmers was done though Boere In Nood, which was established in 2015 to deal with the crisis faced by farmers. &#x201c;Volvo Trucks realised that while the drought is taking its toll on a lot of communities the people that feel the harshest impact of the drought is very often one of our customers &#x2013; farmers. To this end we investigated various manners in which Volvo Trucks Southern Africa would not only be able to assist the drought-stricken farmers but also see first-hand the impact of the assistance given to the farmers,&#x201d; says Valentia Hobbs, general manager, marketing and communication. Volvo Trucks offered the three trucks and provided drivers and diesel to the vehicles that would travel around South Africa. The truck drivers were often the unspoken heroes of the day as they faced some harsh words while going about their duties to deliver the much-needed feed to farmers in the country. &#x201c;We are proud of our association and the impact that we have been able to make through this collaboration with Boere In Nood. The work may be far from over, however, it is a privilege to have been able to make a real difference to the people affected, as well as the animals whose lives were saved from the deliveries of the feed,&#x201d; concludes Valentia.
