Although Franki did not get through, I tracked him down to find out more about what makes him tick and to make sure he keeps the passion going. What does music mean to you? Music is a form of expression like no other. Through music, experiences are created for the listener and also the artist. It is an undeniable universal language which transcends culture, beliefs and differences. Melody is one of the most powerful forces in existence; all in some way or another feels it instantly. Music to me is freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of the mind. To me, music is passion displayed in its greatest form. Your hero&#x2019;s?

Michael Jackson &#x2013; Human Nature Dream gig to do? At this moment, Cape Town Stadium when it&#x2019;s packed out! Performing in front of your home audience is always the greatest feeling. Ultimately sharing a stage with all our biggest acts coming together for a good cause and having every person present embrace the moment. What makes you stand out? My positive outlook on life and my ability to remain calm during what may seem to be a crisis to others. My ability to remain cool, calm and collected, no matter what, may even cause a frown on some faces. If you mean physically then my height and I don&#x2019;t mean because I&#x2019;m tall. Nicknames? Frank the Tank If you were not a musician, what would you do? Life coach or fitness trainer &#x2013; helping people understand and live out their full potential is of great interest to me or, on the more selfish side, a professional gamer.

Michael Jackson - Thriller Guns and Roses &#x2013; Greatest Hits Justin Timberlake &#x2013; FutureSex Love Sound Prime Circle &#x2013; Hello Crazy World Bob Marley - Legend What does the usual mean? My days consist of &#x201c;the usual&#x201d; things such as gym, playing guitar, writing music and overall improvements in other aspects of music. Then there is also spending time with my wife and an overly active mind on what the next move I will make is. In the week I&#x2019;m very strict on eating clean as fitness and feeling your best is a big part of my everyday so a good old low carb diet is definitely a part of the usual for me. Favourite fashion garment Navy blue military-styled jacket. Give us some real proper slang and what it means. &#x201c;Grab a casual&#x201d; &#x2013; grabbing a drink. &#x201c;Smash a sesh&#x201d; &#x2013; (one of my favourites) meaning it's time to make music or time to hit the gym. What do you complain about most often? Peak hour traffic &#x2013; I feel that time could be spent in a more productive way than just sitting and waiting, at which point I start doing vocal warmups *lol*. What is your fear? Living a life not driven by passion. On stage I tend to? Take a deep breath to soak in the moment before connecting with the crowd. What are you doing next? I am releasing a new single entitled &#x201c;Romeo and Juliet&#x201d;. It&#x2019;s a fictional tale which speaks about challenges faced by people of different cultures, backgrounds and beliefs, but ultimately love always prevails.
