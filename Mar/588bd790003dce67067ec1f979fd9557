Learners are exposed to all facets of the specialist integrated marketing and communications departments of Grey Africa giving them an opportunity to get well-rounded insights as to on how the departments work and how to produce effective communications. The learnership programme runs over a period of 12 months with the first six months providing a solid theoretical foundation while students continue to attend lectures at the Red & Yellow School of Advertising. This is followed by six months of practical experience in the various business units at Grey while completing the theoretical segment through R&Y and the following six months they will be exposed to a range of expert skill sets in the various departments. &#x201c;It is with great pleasure that Grey is part of making a tangible difference to the industry by outing its money where its mouth is by investing in learnerships like this. The advertising industry is starting to attract students from all walks of life. &#x201c;It is a great pleasure for Grey to be able to give the learners an opportunity to be exposed to the challenges and opportunities we deal with on a daily basis at this stage of their careers, because they will be getting insights in every aspect of the business, which gives them invaluable practical experience,&#x201d; says Paul Jackson, Managing Director of Grey Africa. The programme also provides a good indication of which career they should follow, and affords them sufficient insights to help them make the right career choices for the future. Upon completion of the learnership programme, the learners will obtain a National Certificate in Advertising NQF level 5.
