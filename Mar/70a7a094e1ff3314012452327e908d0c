&#x201c;All the classics will be in there,&#x201d; Sipho divulges, &#x201c;Including Burn Out, Shikisha, and many more songs that have shaped me as a musician, philanthropist and father to my beautiful daughters.&#x201d; As to what FreshlyGround fans can expect from the multi-platinum-selling globetrotters, with their sixth album currently in final production with Swedish producer Tore Johannson, the band may just offer a sample of what&#x2019;s to come from the group in the months ahead. &#x201c;There will be material never performed before,&#x201d; Zolani teases. &#x201c;There will also be some deviations from the usual popular material too.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never played at Spier before,&#x201d; Sipho declares. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve also never performed with FreshlyGround before either. I have huge respect for the music they create, and they are lovely people which just enhances the whole experience.&#x201d; The much-applauded Around The Fire and Wrestling With Dawn producer, playwright and performer, Siphokazi Jonas will also share the stage on the night, revealing yet another side to her dynamic talent. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m delighted to have her open for us,&#x201d; Sipho says. &#x201c;I have watched Siphokazi, over the last two years, create her own path and make work for herself, all of which needs to be heard and applauded. I&#x2019;m really looking forward to a great night.&#x201d; A long overdue marriage of two trailblazers, expect pomp, ceremony and a night filled with celebration and tumultuous applause. Join the chorus and come sing along. Ticket details Tickets are available now from Computicket.
