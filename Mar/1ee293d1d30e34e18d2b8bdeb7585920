Conceptualised by Native VML, the campaign aims to inspire South Africans to publicly commit to making their dreams a reality today, rather than one day, later, just now or now now. Kyle Lewis brings his distinctive visuals to the launch film, which features the likes of creative collective I See A Different You, broadcast personality Kede Mkhabela and publicist Melanie Ramjee. Lebogang Rasethaba&#x2019;s short documentary features Dear Ribane and MyCityByNight&#x2019;s Craig Stack discussing the projects they&#x2019;ve pledged to stop procrastinating over; while Zandi Tisani&#x2019;s two films pair Moonchild Sanelly with The Sartists and Mashayabhuqe Kamaba with Rasethaba respectively. &#x201c;The work is looking ridiculously cool and the spirit in which the shoot ran really was amazing,&#x201d; said Native VML&#x2019;s Michelle Kreuiter. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s particularly impressive to run three shoots at the same time and end up with this level of calmness on set and quality in the lens.&#x201d; Make your commitment today at makeoneday.today.
