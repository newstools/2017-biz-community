Saatchi Synergize walked away with paid search marketing craft silver for clients ADT, P&G and Toyota as well as a paid search marketing bronze pixel for the Toyota vehicle range&#x2019;s &#x2018;Driving media efficiency&#x2019;. That&#x2019;s why the team sent through the above GIF of Homer Simpson doing the happy dance on the spot to show how they&#x2019;re currently feeling. The Saatchi Synergize paid search team on stage at the Bookmarks 2017 Adam Mitchell, paid media director, says: &#x201c;The Saatchi & Saatchi Synergize paid media team has an ethos of quality over quantity. We are a tight-knit team of specialists who feel the overall calibre of digital work is getting better and better each year in terms of creativity, innovation, technology and data usage, as well as adding real value to consumers and businesses. We are extremely pleased with our two paid search wins &#x2013; a category bronze for Toyota and a craft silver for ADT, P&G and Toyota.&#x201d; Trumpeting entry testimonials Mitchell also sent through testimonies from their entries that speak of their specific paid search work results: P&G: &#x201c;Saatchi Synergize have been a partner for over three years and in that time have transformed the way P&G think about search and content marketing globally. The results have been nothing short of spectacular, reducing spend by 45% in paid search whilst driving double the amount of traffic to key touch points by increasing organic visibility and increasing engagement scores across all content. Synergize has since been recognised by our client as best in class globally and the work has also been recognised by independent third party reviewers, reaching the highest accolade of &#x2018;genius in category&#x2019;. They continue to exceed expectations around the world.&#x201d; &#x2013; John Kinder, global digital director at Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide. Toyota: &#x201c;Our agency initially partnered with Synergize so they could conduct a performance audit on our existing work, and from there grew into a full account restructure. From the start, our partnership with Synergize has delivered immediate and ongoing value, netting tangible efficiencies and allowing Toyota&#x2019;s closely managed paid search budget to deliver an even better ROI. The team at Synergize is staffed with true SEM subject matter experts, each able to identify not only opportunities for improvement, but also actionable solutions.&#x201d; &#x2013; Conrad Nussbaum, group director and general manager of business and analytics at Saatchi & Saatchi LA.
