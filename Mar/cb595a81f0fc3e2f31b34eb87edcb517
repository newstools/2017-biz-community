Well, I am with you, Mr voice-over artist, what the hell are you saying? In the spirit of responsible communication let&#x2019;s delve a little deeper and deconstruct "taste tomorrow today" in the hope of holding that ever eager child, cynicism at bay. (c) Rommel Canlas - 123RF.com Does "taste tomorrow today" mean&#x2026; Option 1 The act of vaping with this product gives you time travelling powers, so you can vape today &#x2013; and zap! go forward in time, eat something, and zap! go back to present vaping moment? If so, does this mean that whatever last you tasted is the taste that describes the day? Does time have taste? Are Wednesday&#x2019;s sweeter than Mondays? Probably. Monday must taste like the back end of a camel after a dry spell in the Sahara while Friday tastes like pure golden honey. Option 2 Obviously the above is nonsense, so the sentiment behind this pay-off line must be that those who choose to vape with this product, are so on trend, they have skipped right to tomorrow, &#x2018;cause guess what? They already know what&#x2019;s happening, because without them &#x2013; there is no tomorrow. Boom! Option 3 It just sounds good in that sort of abstract cool way. The client and creative behind this line, know it&#x2019;s bulls#!t, we know it&#x2019;s bulls#!t &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not your garden variety bulls#!t, this is A-grade stuff, so they hope it&#x2019;ll just blend into the advertising wallpaper that no one ever questions, for fear of being perceived as&#x2026; off trend. Option 4 The client&#x2019;s wife came up with the line and because he&#x2019;s cheating on her, he&#x2019;ll agree to anything she says to soften his guilt. Option 5 The client came up with this line while banging his mistress. He had to stop mid-coitus to write it down, because he&#x2019;s that good &#x2013; and that line, is that hot. Option 6 Agency chorus (delivered with feeling): &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an international brand and the client made us use it.&#x201d; Option 7 I can&#x2019;t hold it off any longer, cynicism has battered down the door of reason. Truth is, this line is a tumbleweed. It means nothing, it says nothing, it stands for nothing, pretty much like the product it is advertising. It&#x2019;s as thick in substance or meaning as a puff of smoke. *Note that Bizcommunity staff and management do not necessarily share the views of its contributors &#x2013; the opinions and statements expressed herein are solely those of the author.*
