Fieldspace VR launch"We know that one of the most difficult tasks for a broker is taking a potential client into a space and convincing them that it will meet their unique requirements. We are giving brokers the opportunity to show their clients a view of a fully refurbished space using the latest virtual reality technology," says the company in its latest release. "All the broker needs to do is to spark an idea in their client&#x2019;s mind that will enable them to imagine the possibilities in the spaces we have to offer." Virtual tours 360 degree tours of certain Fieldspace properties are also available on its website. This gives potential tenants the ability to experience a virtual tour of the premises without commuting to the actual building. This is common practice in the residential market overseas, says th ecompany, however the South African commercial property market has not yet capitalised on this functionality until today. &#x201c;We constantly strive to improve our offering and give potential tenants everything they need to assist them in the decision-making process. We understand that it&#x2019;s hard to visualise your perfect space when looking at an empty shell, and we want to assist with that process as much as possible,&#x201d; said Scott Field, CEO of Fieldspace Property Group.
