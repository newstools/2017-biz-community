Customers who wish to support the disaster relief efforts in the area are encouraged to do so by donating from R5 or more to the Group&#x2019;s #ActForChange Fund at the till point of any Shoprite or Checkers store across the country. All proceeds from the Fund up to the end of March will be donated directly to relief efforts in the area. All Shoprite (75) and Checkers (42) stores across the Western Cape will also be accepting non-perishable donations to assist the Imizamo Yethu fire victims. The group&#x2019;s mobile soup kitchen was immediately dispatched to serve in the community and will continue to provide hot meals for those affected for the duration of the week. Meanwhile, further support for the victims of the fire as well as the teams assisting with the relief efforts continues to pour in from both its Shoprite and Checkers stores in and around the area. Care hampers containing bottled water, grab & go meals, energy bars, Powerade and toiletries have been made available to both the teams fighting the fires on the ground as well as the impacted community. Chicken, beans, fresh fruit and vegetables have been donated to organisations, such as the Red Cross, who are providing additional support with feeding schemes that are serving in the community. A Shoprite truck has been made available to assist with the transportation of donated goods to and from central points, while a team of volunteers from the Shoprite group is assisting with the disaster relief efforts, being coordinated through Thula Thula Hout Bay for the duration of this week.
