Our short film, Sea Change, which educates surfers to be more mindful about using sustainable surfboard materials, launched at the Wavescape Film Festival 2016. To promote the film, we created a laser-engraved poster (made from environmentally friendly cork) which peels off and converts into a deck pad to be used on surfboards. The poster thus becomes a literal example of Sea Change. Poster 1: Ancient Hawaiian Heritage Our message plays on surf jargon about a style of surfing (Goofy vs Natural). It doubles up as a message about using surf products that are natural and sustainable, like our Hawaiian forefathers did. The &#x2018;Rethink your Ride&#x2019; message encourages surfers to change their mindset about protecting the ocean every time they take to the sea. Poster 2: One with Nature Our message plays on surf jargon about surfing etiquette. To &#x2018;drop in&#x2019; is to take off on a wave which is already being ridden. Our poster suggests that if you&#x2019;re not riding sustainably, you&#x2019;re disrespecting Mother Nature. Our illustration shows Mother Nature empowered to protect her ocean. The fluidity of our lettering and imagery embodies this ideal: all elements working together in balance. The &#x2018;Rethink your Ride&#x2019; campaign line encourages surfers to change their mindset about protecting the ocean every time they take to the sea.
