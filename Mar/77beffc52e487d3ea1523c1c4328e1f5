Aileen Lamb Bridget McCarneyMcCarney, MD of New Media for the past 15 years, has led the company through many changes. Under her award-winning leadership the company grew its profits by more than 600%, staff increased from 30 to 250, and the company grew from a custom-publishing venture into a full-service strategic and content agency. In her role as general manager of New Media&#x2019;s consumer division, Aileen has been the driving force behind the digitisation and relaunch of successful media brands such as Eat Out, VISI and Woolworths TASTE. She has also succesfully led the annual Eat Out Restaurant Awards to great heights with a record number of 740 guests attending this glamorous event last year. Prior to this she held the position of national advertising director at New Media, where she achieved astonishing results in a diminishing environment. Aileen started her digital journey in 2000 at Newsquest Media in Scotland, where she commercially developed a portfolio of digital-first consumer brands. Says Bridget: &#x201c;It has been my pleasure to have grown New Media from a fledging custom publisher to the country&#x2019;s leading content-marketing agency. Aileen will drive this change even further and faster.&#x201d; &#x201c;This move takes me into a broader role that includes growing our sister companies and focusing on important strategic pillars such as Matrix24,&#x201d; says Bridget. &#x201c;The change will allow me to focus on the elements I believe to be the most important, including our company culture and the future vision of New Media. I&#x2019;m excited about the move and look forward to a range of new opportunities and challenges.&#x201d; About her successor, Bridget adds: &#x201c;Aileen is a dynamic and fearless leader, with the perfect combination of passion and drive for this new challenge. Her vision will no doubt amplify New Media&#x2019;s successes.&#x201d; Says Aileen: &#x201c;I am honoured to take the reins at New Media at a time when the pace of change is quicker than ever. We have developed an exciting new strategy that will allow us to build on the successes of the past, channel the brilliance of our talented people, and I look forward to discovering new ways in which New Media can play an even more vital part in delivering valuable content for our clients&#x2019; audiences; content that audiences truly want to engage with. New Media has always stood for excellence and this will continue to be at the heart of what we do.&#x201d;
