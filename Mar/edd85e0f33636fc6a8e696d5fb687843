It is for this reason that we are proud to host events such as this JAMMS discussion workshop. These sessions provide an important opportunity for government and industry to identify what we, as a collective, can do to increase the value tourism adds to our economy.&#x201d; &#x201c;We are also heartened by the R110 million bidding fund that Minister Hanekom announced at Meetings Africa last month. Having access to funding and support will enable us to put forward stronger bids in the association market and expand the country&#x2019;s market share in the international conference segment,&#x201d; said Ellingson. The economic benefit of business tourism Winde, who provided one of the keynote addresses, delved into the economic benefit business tourism has on the local economy. &#x201c;Tourism is one of our fastest growing sectors and employs 204,000 people in the Western Cape. Annual foreign direct spend is worth R17.2 billion. We know that business tourists have a higher spend than leisure tourists. Each conference delegate spends an estimated R3 210 per day, according to Wesgro. Since 2014, we have secured bids worth R645 million. This has delivered significant growth and job creation benefits,&#x201d; said Winde. With the CTICC&#x2019;s expansion set to open later in the year, Winde noted the additional value the expansion will bring. &#x201c;The expansion of the Cape Town International Convention Centre, which is jointly funded by a range of stakeholders including the Western Cape Government, is also set to double the centre&#x2019;s existing exhibition capacity. We will see an increase in the number and size of conferences resulting in more business travellers to our region,&#x201d; Winde added.
