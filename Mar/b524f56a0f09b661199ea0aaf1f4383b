&#x201c;It was a typical cheese produced on a specific day,&#x201d; says Healey&#x2019;s general manager Jannik Le Roux. &#x201c;We do not produce special cheese for competitions anymore as we want to test ourselves against the best in the business with the cheese that we make on a daily basis. Our clients can thus be assured of a competition-quality cheese on an everyday basis.&#x201d; An untamed, natural approach The SA Champion title follows the recent opening of the new Healey&#x2019;s Cheesery & Deli at Waterkloof, where an untamed, natural approach to winemaking reigns supreme. Waterkloof&#x2019;s biodynamic farming philosophy sits perfectly beside Healey&#x2019;s approach to natural, real cheese that is free of all preservatives, artificial colourants, flavour enhancers and anti-moulds. Healey&#x2019;s joined the Waterkloof family in 2012 as a natural extension of a brand that unlocks nature&#x2019;s true potential in the most natural way but continued production at its small cheesery at Lourensford Estate where it was originally started. Over the years, Healey&#x2019;s improved its equipment and more recently, its facility too. At the end of last year, it was time for Healey&#x2019;s to move on to greener pastures. The opportunity with Waterkloof and its ethos made the estate the perfect choice and it opened its new &#x2018;home&#x2019; right at the foot of the famous winery. It is here the entire process of making slowly matured cheddar takes place in a custom-designed facility. &#x201c;Our team managed to produce this winning SA Champion cheese in a new facility we&#x2019;d occupied for less than a year, and using unfamiliar equipment,&#x201d; says cheesemaker Desiree Stuart who oversees the small, close-knit Healey&#x2019;s team. Healey's Desiree StuartCheesy indulgence The deli where the winning cheese and others are available was designed with a specific vision in mind: the creation of a natural and flowing space for aficionados to taste the finest slow-matured cheddars whilst getting a first-hand glimpse of the intricate process involved in making these award-winning wheels of deliciousness. It has an inviting wooden deck with unobstructed views of the mountain-and-sea landscape that calls for laid-back cheese sampling along with Waterkloof wine sipping with friends and family. Healey&#x2019;s Slow Matured Cheddar is incredibly versatile and can easily be enjoyed with sweet or savoury accompaniment. The one-stop cheese-shop therefore also features other scrumptious bites and artisanal products by some of their favourite local producers. This includes some of the best roasted coffee, olives, cured meats, fresh breads, and delicious jams and preserves. Award-winning cheese Since humble beginnings, Healey&#x2019;s Slow Matured Cheddar has garnered numerous international accolades for its commitment to quality excellence, driven by empowerment and unbridled passion. In 2006 Healey&#x2019;s excelled at the coveted World Cheese Awards in London, bringing home Gold as well as Silver, and in 2009 it claimed Gold status at the World Cheese Canary Island Awards. It was also awarded a Bronze medal at the 2011 World Cheese Awards. Another massive achievement was second place at the World Championships in Wisconsin, the US&#x2019;s most famous cheese state, in 2014, and in 2015 it was crowned SA Champion in the 10-18 months Round Cheddar Category at the South African Dairy Championships.
