Jumia Travel CEO Paul Midy says: &#x201c;We have the requisite capacity to offer our partners global visibility, and to our customers, solutions for all their travel needs anywhere in the world.&#x201d; The move is directed at enabling more Africans to expand their travel horizons both domestically and internationally. As part of the initiative, customers will have access to travel packages to the new destinations, with 24/7 local customer service and expertise as well as flexible payment options including Mpesa, payment on arrival, and credit cards. The packages will consist of hotel stays, return flight tickets, tours or excursions upon request and availability. They exclude Visa processing fees, travel insurance, among other activities not mentioned above. Jumia Travel Nigeria MD, Kushal Dutta also explained: &#x201c;Travellers are increasingly shifting focus from generic products to more customised and personalised experience. We are, therefore, working closely with our hotels and other OTA partners to provide our customers with tailor-made worldwide travel options&#x201d;. The first package focuses on Dubai as an outbound destination for African customers during the upcoming Easter holidays.
