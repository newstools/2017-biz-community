Menlyn Maine exterior The Capital Menlyn Maine boasts Koi as its in-house restaurant, flexible accommodation arrangements, state-of-the-art conference facilities and easy access to the trendy Menlyn Maine precinct. The Capital Hotel Group was established in 2008 and owns 75% of the extended-stay, or apartment hotel, rooms available in South Africa. It has seven hotels across South Africa, excluding The Capital Menlyn Maine. Its occupancy rates are 80%, well above the 55% average hotel occupancy rates in South Africa. &#x201c;We are delighted to bring our world-class apartment hotel model to Tshwane, which has been lagging behind Johannesburg, Cape Town and South Africa&#x2019;s other cities in terms of convenient, affordable, luxurious extended-stay accommodation. We believe that The Capital Menlyn Maine will revolutionise the accommodation industry in Tshwane,&#x201d; says Marc Wachsberger, founder and managing director of The Capital Hotel Group. Wachsberger says The Capital Menlyn Maine &#x2013; which took just under R300-million to build &#x2013; is expected to break even in just three months, in line with the other hotels it has launched. &#x201c;The Capital Menlyn Maine is just another step on our path to remain the fastest-growing hotel group in South Africa. It is also in line with our ambitions to expand into Africa, where we plan on opening a minimum of two new hotels a year,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;While the apartment hotel or extended-stay concept is new to South Africa and Africa, it is not new to the world, where it accounts for 9% of hotel offerings. We intend to remain at the forefront of bringing the apartment hotel or extended-stay concept to South Africa and Africa.&#x201d;
