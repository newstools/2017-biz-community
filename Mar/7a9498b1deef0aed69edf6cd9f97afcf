This travel destination is a hub for adventure seekers from all around the world &#x2013; be it to bungee jump (as well-known actor Will Smith did recently), gorge swing, abseil or do the flying fox over the Zambezi River. Livingstone is commonly known as Africa&#x2019;s &#x201c;adventure capital&#x201d;. Image supplied White-water rafting down the rapids of the Zambezi One extreme aquatic-adventure which is a magnet to the area for adventurous tourists is white-water rafting down the rapids of the Zambezi &#x2013; an adrenalin activity like no other. TripAdvisor is packed with rave reviews from international happy campers who have taken part in the thrilling experience which some describe as &#x201c;the wildest one-day white-water run in the world&#x201d;. These trips are a tremendous challenge for kayakers and rafters alike as the inflatable craft crash through the waves, launch into the air and those onboard go head-to-head with the elements. There are 25 rapids on the Zambezi River &#x2013; just downstream of Victoria Falls &#x2013; varying from easy to advanced. The rapids are at their most exciting when the river level is lower (roughly between August and January), with the waves and drops being more pronounced. The rapids may seem less dramatic when the river level is at its highest (February to July) but due to strong whirlpools and undercurrents, it is potentially more dangerous. Rafting trips start further down the Gorge at this time of year, excluding the higher-grade rapids upstream. The journey down the rapids can vary between an intense adrenalin rush &#x2013; as the raft is swirled along in the white-water &#x2013; to breathless tranquillity as the craft drifts downstream between the soaring cliffs of the Batoka Gorge. Wildlife on the riverbanks competes with the breath-taking scenery as welcome distractions along the way.
