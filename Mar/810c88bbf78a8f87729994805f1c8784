The partnership between Woolworths and SAFW has prioritised fast-tracking South Africa fashion from the runway to the rails. From modern streetwear to footwear and accessories inspired by the continent, the debut collaboration was available online straight from the runway - a first for SAFW. Charmaine Huet, Woolworths&#x2019; group director of Marketing and Sustainability, says, &#x201c;As a passionately South African retailer we want to boost the visibility and viability of local designers. The quality of the work on show last night, and the response to it, is compelling proof of the incredible local talent the South African fashion industry has on offer.&#x2019;&#x2019; Having introduced the concept of local design collaborations with the Stoned Cherrie, Craig Native and Maya Prass collections over a decade ago, it&#x2019;s another step forward for the local retailer. The StyleBySA capsule collection will be available exclusively online while stocks last this week. The collection launches in selected Woolworths stores (Canal Walk Shopping Centre, Cape Town; Sandton City Shopping Centre, Johannesburg; Mall of Africa, Midrand; Menlyn Mall, Pretoria; Gateway Theatre of Shopping, Durban) from 12 April 2017.
