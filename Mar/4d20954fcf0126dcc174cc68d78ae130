The new Navara will initially be available in three double cab models, with a 4x4 drive train and the choice of a six-speed manual or new seven-speed automatic gearbox. Over time, the range will expand to include mid- and entry-level models in 4x4 and 4x2 guise, with several additional models in the pipeline. Commercial customer and business owner Taking care of the commercial customer and the small businesses owner are the Nissan NP200 and NP300 Hardbody single-cab models. These models offer the choice of an 800kg payload for the NP200 and up to a 1359kg payload for the single-cab NP300. Both models now also feature a six-year/150,000km comprehensive mechanical warranty as part of the Nissan Assured programme. The NP300 Hardbody has gained significant traction among business owners and farmers for its extensive range of Nissan Approved accessories. &#x201c;Buyers can choose from a wide list of accessories, such as cattle rails and an airbag-compliant bush bar or they can fit a range of accessories by opting for the Agri Pack, Fleet Pack or several other packs at their local dealer,&#x201d; says Xavier Gobille, director for Sales, Marketing and Aftersales at Nissan Group of Africa. Navara to complement NP200, NP300 Hardbody The all-new Navara will expand over time to complement the NP200 and NP300 Hardbody in both the workhorse and leisure segments. First to market will be three 4x4 models with the choice of SE and LE grade levels. All three models will feature Nissan&#x2019;s next-generation dual-turbo diesel engine that delivers 140 kW and a strong 450Nm from a low 1500 rpm, maintaining linear power delivery up to 2500 rpm for a wide and flat torque curve. The first locally available double-cab variants of the new Navara will all feature a host of safety and luxury features, such as seven airbags, a touch screen infotainment system and Nissan&#x2019;s new six-year/150,000km mechanical warranty as part of the Nissan Assured programme. These models will also feature Nissan&#x2019;s innovative coil spring rear suspension set-up. Workhorse credentials &#x201c;While the luxury versions of the new Navara reach us first, there is no doubting the new pick-up&#x2019;s workhorse credentials. These double-cab models have a load box capacity of 1061 litres and they can tow braked trailers weighing up to 3.5 tonnes, doubling the capacity on offer by the NP300 Hardbody,&#x201d; says Gobille. The first demonstration models of the all-new Nissan Navara will be available at dealers in March 2017.
