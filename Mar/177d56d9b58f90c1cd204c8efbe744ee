Highlighting three premium wines from Nederburg&#x2019;s The Winemasters collection, the campaign features the latest vintages of its Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. A printed map of the Nederburg wine farm in Paarl displays key milestones in Nederburg&#x2019;s history, via illustrations and snippets of information, cleverly disguised to encourage consumers to use a supplied magnifying glass to search for and find the hidden messages. Upon finding these, consumers may ask their waitron for a reward. This special promotion concludes on 30 April 2017. View a list of participating restaurants.
