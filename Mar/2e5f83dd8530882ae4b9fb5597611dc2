Gold Travel's new look They are currently updating their website and internal processes and procedures to provide a more efficient, professional and personalised experience for their clients. Konrad Laker, CEO of Gold Travel, says, &#x201c;We took an honest look at the way we do things and decided it was time for a change - we want to show our clients that we are adapting but within a given framework &#x2013; we are the same people, but doing business a little differently and a whole lot better. As a small business, it is possible for us to do more; to go the extra mile.&#x201d; This rebrand comes in line with the opening of a second Gold Travel branch in Centurion and further expansion plans are under way for a third branch in Midrand, Gauteng. The company is also eager to extend their footprint into Africa as their portfolio covers a lot of travel to destinations like Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya, and many of their clients have offices in those countries. Laker believes that the travel service industry should be embracing technology rather than resisting it: "We want to revolutionise the way we do business and challenge the norm while keeping our personal focus on our clients and their needs. With adopting new systems and technology, the idea is for Gold Travel to duplicate the formula so that it can be rolled out to all new branches, a kind of 'plug-and-play' scenario, creating a seamless transition for both client and consultant."
