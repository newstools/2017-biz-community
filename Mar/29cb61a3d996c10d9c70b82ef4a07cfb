Disrupt Africa reported in March last year DealDey was acquired by the Ringier Africa Deals Group, a newly formed joint venture between Ringier Africa and Silvertree Internet Holdings. The joint venture was created by a carve out of the leading Kenyan online deals business Rupu out of Ringier Kenya, and of the leading Ghanaian online deals platform Tisu out of Ringer Ghana; with the aim of leading the group of online deals businesses to continued success based on a long-term, joint plan. A year later, Ringier has exited the Ringier Africa Deals Group, in order to focus on the company&#x2019;s classifieds, content and marketing plays. As of last week, DealDey is now fully owned by Silvertree, continuing with its deal-based e-commerce model. Rupu and Tisu became part of PPromos earlier this year, which is part of Ringier Digital Publishing; with these companies focusing on content-driven deals. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re super excited to have 100% of such an icon of the African online space, and have lots of exciting projects underway, plus good synergies realised and coming with the rest of the Silvertree portfolio,&#x201d; said Paul Cook, founder and managing director of Silvertree Capital.
