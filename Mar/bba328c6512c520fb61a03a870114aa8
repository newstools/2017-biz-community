Picture: OpenViewHD.co.za eMovies Extra will offer viewers premium entertainment in HD &#x2013; including sitcoms, drama series, reality, telenovelas, court shows, lifestyle and movies. While the channel is infused with a good measure of suspense, drama and action, a touch of comedy adds a light-hearted flavour to the line-up. It can best be described as young, urban, modern and cosmopolitan. The True African channel is a snapshot of contemporary Africa, highlighting handpicked premium entertainment and lifestyle content from across the entire continent. It is vibrant, energetic, trend setting and innovative in telling the stories of the people and nations of Africa. While the viewership steadily increases, to almost 800,000 households, OpenView HD is also hard at work to deliver more content and channels to viewers. Marlon Davids, MD at e.tv, says, &#x201c;Our viewers enjoy watching movies in HD, so the addition of eMovies Extra is the logical next step in bolstering our content offering on OpenView HD.&#x201d; OpenView HD is the only free digital satellite platform in South Africa, powered by e.tv. The decoder is available from all leading retailers from as little as R399 (excludes dish/installation). For more information, go to www.etv.co.za.
