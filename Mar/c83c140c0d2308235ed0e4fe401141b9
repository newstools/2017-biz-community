Scully Scooters&#x2019; vision is to &#x201c;get South Africa moving&#x201d;, one scooter &#x2013; and one job opportunity &#x2013; at a time. To date, the organisation has put more than 800 previously disadvantaged youth into either work or their own business. &#x201c;The work that Scully Scooters does, in terms of job creation and enterprise development, is very much in line with what we believe at Relate: that it is essential to create opportunities for South Africans to grow and succeed to enable a better future for our country,&#x201d; says Neil Robinson, CEO of Relate Bracelets. &#x201c;We have selected one of Scully Scooters&#x2019; many solutions that enables three new opportunities for employment and business creation. Our R100,000 investment will equip three previously disadvantaged youth with everything they need to run a business-on-a-bike. They enter a Scully Scooters programme, which includes them learning the attitudinal and behavioural skills to ride a scooter safely as well as how to run their small business. We&#x2019;ve provided them with 150cc scooters along with all necessary safety accessories for them to commence their business immediately after training.&#x201d; Robinson adds that with more than a quarter of the population currently unemployed, it is vital that non-profit organisations, and corporates alike, work together to come up with solutions to this major problem. UberEats delivery riders All three beneficiaries will be included in the Uber family, using their new scooters to operate as delivery riders for UberEats. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re using these scooters to start and build their own businesses for themselves as UberEats riders, but it&#x2019;s also a gateway for them to enter the very many opportunities opening up in the scooter delivery, courier and business-on-a-bike space,&#x201d; Robinson explains. Scooter recipient Recardo Swail says that there should be more employment opportunities like this for youth in South Africa. &#x201c;This opportunity means that myself, and other youth, will be able to enter into the job market and secure a job into the long term,&#x201d; says Swail. Fellow recipient Kelly du Plessis says her new business-on-a-bike is an &#x201c;awesome opportunity&#x201d; for her to move forward in her life. &#x201c;The rate of unemployment is so high and right now I can&#x2019;t afford to stay at home doing nothing. I&#x2019;m used to working and I love being on the road,&#x201d; says Du Plessis, adding that the opportunity is a major stepping stone for success for her. The recipients will also receive the guidance and mentorship they need to succeed in their new business venture. Relate enterprise development fund Funds were allocated to this partnership from Relate&#x2019;s ongoing enterprise development fund. For every Relate Bracelet sold at till points of retailers across South Africa (Woolworths, Clicks, Nando&#x2019;s, Cape Union Mart, Poetry, and many more), or through Relate&#x2019;s online store, a portion of the proceeds is allocated to this fund. &#x201c;We believe that more people should have the opportunity to earn a living for themselves. We have been providing platforms of opportunity to our students since 2012, and we remain the industry leaders when it comes to the training of young people in the skill of riding a scooter safely, with the express intention of getting them an income-earning opportunity,&#x201d; says Linlee Solms, Cape Town GM of Scully Scooters.
