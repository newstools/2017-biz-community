Bruce Cleaver, CEO, De Beers Group, said: &#x201c;Today marks a significant landmark for De Beers in Canada as Gahcho Ku becomes an important contributor to the group&#x2019;s global production. That the mine has reached this landmark, on budget and ahead of schedule, is testament to the partnerships that have worked together since construction began. Patrick Evans, president and CEO of Mountain Province Diamonds, added: &#x201c;The dedicated support of our shareholders, business partners and employees has made today&#x2019;s important achievement possible. Gahcho Ku is a rich diamond deposit that secures Canada&#x2019;s position as one of the world&#x2019;s leading diamond producers. Our thanks and appreciation goes to our operating partner, De Beers Canada, for delivering the Gahcho Ku mine safely and ahead of schedule.&#x201d;
