But their agricultural importance is undervalued and they often play second fiddle to more commercial crops...By Ethel Phiri, Palesa Natasha Mothapo 31 May 2017Miracel plantThey are also easy to grow. "If you take a cactus pad and you throw it like a Frisbee, it will land flat and make roots from whatever it is that touches the soil," said Mounir Louhaichi, principal scientist at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA)."It can grow anywhere. It doesn't need irrigation because it's made out of water. It makes use of marginal land," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of the launch."That's why it's a miracle plant."The book, co-published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and ICARDA, said the rural poor and smallholders were most heavily affected by changes in the climate. "If people are to survive in these ever harsher conditions, their crops need to withstand drought, high temperatures and poor soils," it said, adding that the prickly pear was ideal for such conditions.Reporting By Thin Lei Win, Editing by Emma BathaThomson Reuters Foundation
