"That there was radioactivity in Mounana is a reality. (But) to what degree and to what extent the workers were affected, it will be very difficult to establish," a former senior executive of the mine told AFP, on condition of anonymity.In similar disputes elsewhere in the world, experts acknowledge the difficulty of pinning cancer and respiratory diseases on nuclear exposure at work. Smoking and other "lifestyle" habits could, for instance, be a cause.Areva has been under pressure to compensate its employees for more than a decade.In 2007, French NGOs Sherpa and Medecins du Monde (Doctors of the World) carried out field surveys in Mounana and in Niger, another Areva uranium mining site.They published a report denouncing what they described as high rates of cancer among former employees.Areva agreed to investigate the situation and launched a health initiative in 2009 -- the Mounana Health Observatory (OSM) -- promising to pay compensation and treat former miners who fell ill, provided scientific and medical panels confirmed their disease was attributable to industrial causes.Seven years on, not one former employee has been compensated."I've had difficulty breathing for 10 years," says 77-year-old Roland Mayombo, who spent 27 years in the mine."I went to the OSM four times a year, but I have never had a result," he complained."We decided to stop going (to the OSM) because no one has ever given us our analysis results," said Estime Beno Ngodi, president of Matrac, who says he is suffering from lung cancer.Comuf accuses Matrac of spreading "misinformation" and defends its handling of the health initiative.It looked at more than 650 former workers but suspended the project in 2015 because of a boycott by Matrac, says Gilles Recoche, Comuf's's director of the board."We're proud of having set up a unique tripartite structure, which enabled former Comuf workers to benefit from a free medical visit," he adds.For the surviving miners, their long battle to prove a direct link between their illness and uranium contamination goes on. But, for many, age and sickness are wearing them down."It's battle between David and Goliath," sighs Massala.
