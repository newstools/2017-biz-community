The company has worked hard to retain a boutique agency feel premised on accountability, flexibility, autonomy and accessibility. However, its impact is by no means small. By researching the most effective marketing tools and devising strategies suited to individual clients, Jellyfish has expanded its network, delivering scale and reach for global brands. More streamlined focus on regional marketThe full-service digital offerings of Jellyfish include analytics – earning them the RAR Digital Award for Analytics – brand analysis and re-structuring; targeted digital marketing across all platforms; conversion optimisation; as well as website development and management; among many others. The latest company integration will further enhance the services offered by Jellyfish with a more streamlined focus on the regional market.Lombard said they were looking forward to making waves within the South African digital landscape. “When compared globally, South Africa is still some way behind, but catching up at a rapid rate. We see our clients now spending significantly more in this space than they did a year or two ago, and new clients are entering this space with a sense of optimism and more regularity. It has taken some time, but 2018 could see us reach a tipping point.”With the company acquisition underway, Jellyfish is already getting prepared to astound the local market.“We have ambitious plans to acquire new office space which reflects our culture and offers our clients a really impactful experience,” said Lombard. “Our training proposition requires significant infrastructure, access, parking and state-of-the-art facilities, all of which we are building into our new office plans. We’re going big. We’re set on emulating the success that our UK and US agencies have already shown by winning Performance Agency of the Year in 2017 for their respective regions. And the ClickMaven deal is an indication of our ambition in the South African market!”
