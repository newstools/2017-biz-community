The au naturel was hands-down the winner, so fresh that no embellishment other than salt and lemon was needed. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/421052-625x416.jpg" alt="Bilboa joins Kove Collection's Camps Bay eateries" width="625" height="416">We also sampled a plate of spiced whitebait served with a lemon and roast garlic aioli. This was my first time sampling whitebait and these crisply flavourful babies were a great introduction, so moreish and excellently complemented by the creamy and generous aioli.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/421053-625x416.jpg" alt="Bilboa joins Kove Collection's Camps Bay eateries" width="625" height="416">Mains included the Red Drum Sea Bass with clams, olives, tomato, garlic and thyme, this was a light and fresh Mediterranean dish perfect for summertime dining. I added a side of creamy mash and paired it with a glass of chilled Kove Collection by Diemersdal chardonnay. Perfection, well almost my only complaint was that only one clam seemed to have made it onto my plate.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/421054-625x416.jpg" alt="Bilboa joins Kove Collection's Camps Bay eateries" width="625" height="416">My partner chose the sirloin which was topped with pink peppercorn, parmesan and truffle. Beautifully tender this is a great meat option and can be paired with a variety of sides; mash, house chips, green salad, baby potatoes, spiced rice and roast carrots.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/421055-625x416.jpg" alt="Bilboa joins Kove Collection's Camps Bay eateries" width="625" height="416"> Sweet territoriesAfter a little breather, we were ready to dive into sweet territories with our choice of the lemon tart and backed chocolate. Two desserts on different ends of the confectionary spectrum but each equally delicious.The lemon tart served with roasted meringue, lemon curd and a yoghurt ice cream is a mouth-watering pop of fresh and tart flavours while the baked chocolate with salted hazelnuts, Kahlua jelly and coffee ice cream is rich and deeply flavoured dessert.Make way for Bilboa, a serious contender in the flourishing Camps Bay foodie scene.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/421063-625x416.jpg" alt="Bilboa joins Kove Collection's Camps Bay eateries" width="625" height="416"> Restaurant Address: Shop 120, First Floor, The Promenade, Victoria Bay, Camps Bay   Contact: +27 (0) 21 286 5155 or E-mail: info@bilboa.co.zabRev('brev-b96ae59a-f767-4626-8169-ce43a2d67070', '>a/\<az.oc.aoblib;46#&ofni>"az.oc.aoblib;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh a<')  Opening Hours: Monday - Sunday: 12h00 - 22h30 For more info go to www.bilboa.co.za
