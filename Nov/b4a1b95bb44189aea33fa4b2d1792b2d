The holistic approach of this bold new movement is aimed at driving awareness, creating conversations and providing tools for people to take positive action as a means of driving a change. #NoExcuse refers to there being no excuse for men to perpetrate any form of violence, and no excuse for people to stand by and do nothing when others abuse.Smart drinking: Challenging South African men to take actionAndrea Quaye, vice president marketing, SAB and AB InBev Africa, says: “Our decision to be an inaugural supporter of the #NoExcuse movement was driven by Carling Black Label’s status as a beacon of masculinity. As the largest beer brand in the country, it is our responsibility to ensure alcohol is consumed responsibly and to use the power of our brand to challenge South African men and our consumers to take action. While many consumers of alcohol drink responsibly and in moderation, it is clear that some people who commit acts of violence have consumed, and often misused, alcohol.“There are no excuses for not getting involved and we hope to get the nation behind us in tackling the issue of gender-based violence. Over time, we would encourage more corporates to join this movement.”The approach is aligned with AB InBev’s Global Smart Drinking Goals aimed at fostering a culture of smart drinking amongst consumers and reducing the harmful use of alcohol. Through the Global Smart Drinking Goals, SAB and AB InBev are making a deeper investment in initiatives that measurably shift social norms and behaviours to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. AB InBev has committed to investing $1bn across the world in dedicated social marketing campaigns and related programs by 2025 to promote smart drinking.The #NoExcuse movement is initially being launched with a thought-provoking television commercial developed to bring awareness to the reality of gender-based violence and the effect it has on lives, families, and communities, followed up by on-the-ground activations.The ongoing #NoExcuse activations will include:• The creation of a #NoExcuse website with suggestions and information on how Champion Men can get involved and what they can do to stop violence in their families, communities and more broadly• A call on men to make a pledge to the movement and to take a stand against gender-based violence• Continued engagement on our digital and other platforms to advise our consumers of, and channel them to work with those programmes that NGO’s are running to tackle gender-based violence• Working with NGO partners to develop an online tool that will function as an always-on virtual counsellor. The Facebook Messenger Bot will engage key audiences and supply resources based on user interaction to allow for continuous and anonymous engagement on gender-based violence for help• A communications campaign on local district radio stations, as well as on social media, educating consumers on the role they can play to get involved and address gender-based violence• Educating and challenging men through the Smart Drinking Squad, an initiative by South African Breweries (SAB) where 100 SAB employees will work with more than 10,000 taverns in key provinces to educate tavern owners and communities to increase participation and ownership in alcohol harm reduction
