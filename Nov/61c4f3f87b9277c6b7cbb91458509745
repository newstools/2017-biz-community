On their AdFocus win, Brand says:Retail advertising is demanding, volume-driven and fast-paced, and delivers instant results. You see the success of your work almost instantly in your client’s sales, and if it doesn’t deliver the expected results, you have to work quickly to turn it around. Checkers has been with us from our inception and we are privileged that, eight years later, our relationship is as strong as ever. To work with clients as smart and committed as the Shoprite Group is a privilege that we don’t take lightly. Our reason for being is to serve our clients and deliver value to them every day, so being acknowledged like this, with an award that recognises our collective achievements, is incredibly rewarding and one of our most treasured accomplishments.Find out more about Brand below...<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/420176-625x325.jpg?2" alt="One of these is Brand in real life…" width="625" height="325">One of these is Brand in real life…1.
