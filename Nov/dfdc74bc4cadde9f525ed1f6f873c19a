Gross profit rose 18.5%, but he cautioned that the improved retail margins were expected to be partially offset by the higher growth in lower-margin fuel sales in the years ahead.Recurring headline earnings increased 18% to 352c per share. A final dividend of 82.6c was declared, raising the full-year payout 18.5% to 112c per share.Drought will have an impactLooking ahead, Walsh believed the effects of the drought would be felt by Kaap Agri's operations around April or May 2018. He said drought conditions in the Western Cape would have an effect on the fruit industry and might slow revenue growth from this sector in 2018."The drought will have an impact, but we will not see negative growth," he said."We have an 18.9% compound annual growth rate over the longer term and will be tempering expectations. But we think we can still achieve double-digit growth in the year ahead."<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/418251-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image Source:" width="120" height="120">Sales grow at Kaap Agri in face of droughtRecently listed farming community retailer Kaap Agri has managed to keep the profit taps open despite a water-shortage crisis afflicting areas in its Western Cape heartland...By Marc Hasenfuss 10 Nov 2017Boosted by a successful diversificationThe company has its roots in the Western Cape but in recent years has expanded the operational footprint to 190 operating points in seven provinces as well as Namibia.Kaap Agri's retail thrust has been boosted by a successful diversification into fuel sales via subsidiary The Fuel Company. Walsh said nine new fuel sites were opened in the year under review, with total fuel volumes increasing 10.9% in the year. He said retail fuel growth would remain an aggressive part of the group's expansion strategy.General retail growth will exceed growth in agricultural retailAnother significant development was the extension and upgrading of the Paarl Agrimark to reflect Kaap Agri's new urban-format retail offering.Walsh disclosed that trading profit from general retail was similar to that of agricultural-related retail. "Indications are that general retail growth will exceed growth in agricultural retail in future."Vunani Securities analyst Anthony Clark said the results showed the inherent strength in Kaap Agri's retailing side. "This performance puts JSE peers like Massmart and Cashbuild to shame." He expected growth on the retail and fuel segments in the financial year ahead, pencilling in earnings of 422c per share.Walsh said the diversification drive in the past few years - mainly in general retail, agricultural-related retail and fuel retail - had gained further traction. "With nearly 90% of Kaap Agri's business flowing from these areas, we are set to continue to deliver ongoing growth."Source: Business Day
