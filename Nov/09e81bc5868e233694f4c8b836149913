It is also able to provide farmers with the exact GPS coordinates of problem areas in orchards.Aerobotics, the company behind the app, said it was able to provide "useful information so farmers can better manage their time and resources on a regular basis, leading to better yields and profits, less wastage in irrigation and pest management."<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1709/410524-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#InnovationMonth: Aerobotics, RanMarine teams up on river water management in #cocreate2Accelerate" width="120" height="120">#InnovationMonth: Aerobotics, RanMarine teams up on river water management in #cocreate2AccelerateAerial data analytics specialist helping farmers optimise their crops, Aerobotics and Dutch environmental technology enterprise, RanMarine, teams up in #cocreate2Accelerate and looks at river water management...By Cari Coetzee 13 Sep 2017While the app gets updated 10m resolution satellite data, farmers can also have areas mapped in 3D by drones using visual and multispectral cameras.South African farmers are large consumers of water for irrigation of agriculture and livestock. The app was designed to help farmers reduce water usage while keeping crops healthy and pest-free, said the company.Source: The Times
