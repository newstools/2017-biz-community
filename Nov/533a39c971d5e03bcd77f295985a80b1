But, we need to be robust to help make a significant impact on the province’s overall water supply,” says Meyer. A much-needed resourceTo prepare for the day the taps run dry, Cape Town mayor, Patricia de Lille last week asked that when the time comes, the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) be on standby at collection points to ensure residents’ safety. Day Zero has moved from March 2018 to May 2018. “As both a hotelier and a resident of this beautiful city, saving water is an imperative. Water is a much-needed resource and without it we can do very little. Therefore, we need to enforce every effort to conserve water,” says Meyer. To-date Meyer says the Westin Cape Town has removed all bath plugs from bathrooms to discourage guests from taking a bath; purchased and implemented water-free Ecolab hand sanitisers in public restrooms and reduced water pressure and implemented air-raters in public restroom taps. Notices informing guests about the drought have been placed in all rooms, public restroom, lifts, as well as in the hotel lobby. In addition, the swimming pool has been filled with 100% non-potable water. “Day Zero is not an option – and it’s all hands on deck in our establishment to do our bit. Little by little we can make a difference, and prevent this crisis from extending further,” Meyer says.
