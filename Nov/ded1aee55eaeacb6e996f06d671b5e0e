Klyne Maharaj, head of brand at Superbalist says the team was extremely excited by the results, “We urged people to get online as soon as the sale opened to bag the best deals and they definitely did – we’ve never seen midnight shopping like that before! By 5:30am we’d achieved over 10% of the day’s target (more than a third of last year’s target) and we saw another spike in traffic later that afternoon as people got home from work and made the purchases they’d been dreaming of all day.”Maharaj says that footwear led the charge in terms of trade, followed by womenswear and menswear. In the pre-Black Friday polls, participants mostly asked for sneaker deals, which was carried across to wishlist activity, with sneakers being the second most popular wishlist want. On the day, sneakers sold more than any other category with Vans Old Skools being the silhouette of choice – a trend Superbalist has seen all year as the kicks sell out almost instantly every time they’re restocked.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/420145-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Black Friday rapidly gathering steam in SA" width="120" height="120">Black Friday rapidly gathering steam in SASouth African retailers are hoping to capitalise on the growing local interest in the annual Black Friday sale, taking place on 24 November this year...By Lauren Hartzenberg 23 Nov 2017Maharaj concludes, “Black Friday was truly exceptional for us and we’d like to thank all our customers for their support on that particular day and every shopping occasion.
