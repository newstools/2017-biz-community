Originally launched in 2005 to expose new and cutting-edge talent to the brand communications industry, the magazine has created a niche for itself as a collector’s magazine for reference and inspiration. The Hero edition lives up to its name, with over 60 conceptually rich pages of visual and written inspiration from the new, the young, the dedicated, the famous and the passionate creative voices of today.  “Heroes are part of our society, since tree-hugging Noah saved all the animals, and Queen Cleopatra brought Caesar to his knees,” says creative director and designer Roanna Williams. “In this issue, we encouraged contributors to be brave and honour their inner creative hero.”The result? Content that is inspiring, engaging, informative and funny. Filled with unbelievable stories and magnificent contributions from South Africa, Kenya, Gabon, USA, Canada, Spain and Slovakia, Migrate offers readers surreal insight into the life of everyday heroes. “In a world of digital and social media, of bits of bytes, Migrate remains stubbornly old-school. It’s a magazine. It’s paper. It’s beautiful and crafted. It’s been made to pleasure your emotions and inspire your soul,” says editor-in-chief and CEO of the Loeries, Andrew Human.Available online at Loeries.com and at independent bookstores across the country – all listed on the Loeries website.
