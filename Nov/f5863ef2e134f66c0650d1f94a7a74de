 The complete Q1 and Q2 shortlist is available here. Third quarter deadline is 30 November 2017 and final deadline for entry is 31 January 2018.Introduced two years ago, The One Show quarterly entry system benefits all parties involved in the process, including creative teams who submit entries, agency management responsible for awards budgeting and judges who review the work.“By submitting work when it’s fresh and top-of-mind, creative teams can more easily access materials while they are readily available, and capitalize in real time on the work’s media coverage and industry buzz,” said Kevin Swanepoel, CEO, The One Club for Creativity. “Agency management gains a budgeting advantage by spreading awards spending over a 12-month period, amounting to four smaller amounts across two calendar years. From a judging perspective, the work is reviewed when it’s fresh and still topical, and jury members can give it greater attention because they’re reviewing smaller batches of entries.”  The quarterly system divides the entry periods into four deadlines, opening in July and ending on 31 January 2018.  The first quarter deadline is 15 August 2017, followed by 30 September 2017, 30 November 2017 and the final one on 31 January, 2018.  The finalists list will be announced in April 2018 in lead up the The One Show awards ceremonies on 9 and 11 May 2018 and during Creative Week in New York.
