"We always try to offer our customers the best buying options with regards to pricing and availability."As the third party seller still had stock at our warehouse on Friday, they won the 'buying box' and their stock was offered to customers as first choice as they would be able to get the item sooner, albeit it a slightly higher price."Source: The Times
