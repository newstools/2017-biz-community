<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/421212.jpg" alt="AAXO lands Platinum Sponsorship from the Ticketpro Dome" width="182" height="187">For Ticketpro Dome, there are two main benefits to this sponsorship package: one, the excellent branding exposure opportunity for them, both before and during AAXO events; and two, the opportunity to make a difference – by offering the ultimate exhibition experience - to AAXO and its membership which represents more than 80 percent of the organiser community in South Africa. The Exhibition of Exhibitions will showcase industry players in the Blue Wing Conference and Events Venue for two days of networking and information sharing, whilst the AAXO ROAR awards will celebrate excellence in the exhibition industry with a gala dinner in the Main Arena of the Ticketpro Dome. The Ticketpro Dome offers unlimited possibilities to the exhibition industry, ranging from the classic exhibitors’ platform to whatever you set your mind on, connecting AAXO with its exhibitions, exhibition visitors and buyers. The venue is ideal for business events, conferences, corporate training presentations, product launches, media and company networking sessions and trade exhibitions. “We are excited about 2018 and the acquisition of a Platinum Sponsorship from the Ticketpro Dome which offers significant advantages for us, our organisers and our associated members,” said Carol Weaving, Chairperson of The Association of African Organiser’s (AAXO).
