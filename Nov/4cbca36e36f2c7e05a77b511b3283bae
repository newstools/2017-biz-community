There are various anxieties that come with being a car owner, from traffic to a lack of parking and wanting to responsibly enjoy a couple of drinks with your friends. For these moments, Uber offers you freedom at a tap. The adverts depict the moment where people break the news to their cars, that this time, they unfortunately cannot not come with them, followed by buckets of reassurance of a reunion.
