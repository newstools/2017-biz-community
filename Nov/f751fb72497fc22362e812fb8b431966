Out of 46 contending 2017 models - the third largest ever - judges picked 10 Car of the Year finalists, including the Alfa Romeo Giulia.All "Of the Year" contenders were selected by judges and evaluated against six key criteria: advancement in design, engineering excellence, safety, efficiency, value, and performance of intended function.
