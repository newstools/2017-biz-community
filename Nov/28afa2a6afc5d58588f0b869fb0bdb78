Two ophthalmologists associated with Mediclinic, Dr Burnet Meyer and Dr Willem Gerber, performed five cataract procedures at the day clinic.By making additional capacity available to the public sector, Mediclinic is able to contribute towards improving the lives of these patients while promoting shared expertise between the private and public healthcare sectors. To date the PPI procedures have been carried out at four Mediclinic hospitals in the Western Cape, either by doctors associated with Mediclinic or from the public sector. PartnershipThe partnership will soon be extended working with the Free State Department of Health. “It is imperative for all healthcare players to engage with each other, private and public alike. We understand that current challenges, such as healthcare professional shortages, impact on both the public and private sector’s ability to deliver care. Through our involvement in PPIs,  we now have the opportunity to add value beyond our traditional patient base,” says Koert Pretorius, CEO of Mediclinic Southern Africa. “Through this partnership we have been able to touch many lives while rising to meet the many healthcare challenges in South Africa. By taking hands and working together across our country, we will be able to better accommodate the significant healthcare needs of all our people,” says Dr Bhavna Patel, CEO of Groote Schuur Hospital.In addition, another role player in the healthcare environment, Eye Pharma, has sponsored the lenses for these 10 cataract procedures.
