The centre employs residents from the local community and plans to take on around 60 young trainees each year. In addition to raising employment levels, the Green Light Project-backed facility increases the number of vehicle mechanics in the region. The company plans to develop the site by supporting the establishment of an adjacent local repair shop, creating further jobs and opportunities in Lideta and Dandora. Ultimately, KIA and KOICA intend for the site to become a self-sufficient business. The training centre is located in the Lideta area of Ethiopia&#x2019;s capital, Addis Ababa. Supported by about $1.8 million investment by KIA Motors and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), the centre is jointly operated by &#x2018;World Vision&#x2019;. World Vision is a relief, development and advocacy non-governmental organisation dedicated to working with 100 million people in countries around the world. &#x201c;Green Light Project centres such as these seek to reduce local unemployment and give disadvantaged communities the chance to establish and run their own businesses. An auto mechanic training centre will provide locals here in Addis Ababa with a valuable service, particularly in a region where so many people rely on their vehicles in order to thrive.&#x201d;
