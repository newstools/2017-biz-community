Andreas SmitAs a below-the-line shopper marketing agency, Isilumko drives one-on-one consumer connection on the ground and helps build meaningful associations between brands and consumers. Referred to as experiential marketing, sampling, promotions, or out of home events &#x2013; regardless of how you choose to label it - the core premise of the activity remains: &#x201c;to build a strong connection between the consumer and the brand&#x201d;. The brand equity that&#x2019;s built in the mind of the consumer is directly proportional to the quality of the memory. While it&#x2019;s true that in the short-term brands need to drive sales to keep the lights on and turn a profit &#x2013; they equally need to build brand love. The more a consumer loves the brand the less it has to invest in keeping that person purchasing their product. At Isilumko we help brands achieve both mandates of short-term sales and long-term brand love! Andreas Smit discusses this and more with Ashraf Garda on Media@SAfm.
