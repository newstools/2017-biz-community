Founded in 1972 in New Orleans, Popeyes is an iconic American brand and a global player in the fried chicken segment of the QSR industry, having carved a niche in the market with its Louisiana-style cuisine. Its restaurants span more than 25 countries, with South Africa being the latest to join the fold. The brand is founded on a 300-year old culinary tradition, which incorporates a fusion of cooking styles, spices and ingredients, derived from African, European, North American and Native American cultural influences. Based on restaurant unit counts, Popeyes is currently ranked as the world's second largest QSR chicken concept. &#x201c;We are bringing the best of the American South to meet Africa&#x2019;s South, and we have no doubt that the culinary similarities &#x2013; including the melting pot of flavours and festive traditions &#x2013; will be well received by South African guests,&#x201d; said Jaye Sinclair, CEO of Siyaghopa Trading Group. &#x201c;We look forward to a successful launch to establish Popeyes in the local market. Going forward, we plan to expand the brand nationally, in a variety of locations, venues and formats, to ensure the majority of South Africa has access to Popeyes in the near future.&#x201d; Burger King's parent buys Popeyes chickenRestaurant Brands International, the parent company of Burger King and Canada's Tim Hortons doughnut shops, said on Tuesday it has reached a deal to buy American fried chicken chain...23 Feb 2017 &#x201c;We are excited that Siyaghopa will develop the brand in the South African market, as we see many opportunities to grow the brand in this market,&#x201d; said Ron Whitt, president of International Popeyes.
