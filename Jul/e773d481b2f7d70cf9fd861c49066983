Holly MeadowsJust a year ago, Meadows was promoted from deputy editor of the magazine to head of commercial content in Associated Media&#x2019;s commercial hub. With her experience on the brand and as a Millennial herself, she knows what the Cosmo reader wants. &#x201c;I know that she demands her editor to think, create and innovate at a dynamic pace &#x2013; and I&#x2019;m looking forward to taking on this challenge." "The role of a modern editor has evolved tremendously," says Kim St Clair Bodden, senior vice president and editorial director at Hearst International. "Creating engaging content is essential &#x2013; but equally as important is the ability to reimagine that content and make it relevant across different platforms. Holly is innovative and imaginative, with a deep understanding of the print, digital and social environments, and we&#x2019;re happy to welcome her back to Cosmopolitan South Africa." Associated Media Publishing&#x2019;s CEO, Julia Raphaely, adds, "Holly is really deserving of this appointment. It has been her dream to edit Cosmopolitan, and I am sure she will flourish in this role. We are excited to see where she leads Cosmopolitan in South Africa." What do you think is the role of the modern editor? Comment on your role specifically, and what it will entail. It&#x2019;s difficult to pin down any job description these days and I think the role of an editor varies vastly from brand to brand. For me, being a modern editor means a lot more than putting together a monthly magazine. You need to think holistically, ahead of the curve all the time and always put the reader first. What excites you most about it, and why are you excited to be back on Cosmopolitan? I&#x2019;m absolutely thrilled to be appointed as the new editor of Cosmopolitan South Africa. We&#x2019;re at a really interesting tipping point in the magazine publishing landscape, and I&#x2019;m excited to take Cosmo into its next phase as a digital, print and experiential pioneer in the South African market. Cosmopolitan is a power brand and it&#x2019;s a phenomenal feeling to be a part of that. It&#x2019;s sharp, smart and bold and has engaged women across the globe for over 50 years now. It exists across 79 countries, more than 30 languages and has a global reach of more than 100-million people &#x2013; to give South Africa a voice amongst that platform excites me. Comment on the state of magazine publishing in South Africa and how you think this compares globally. Globally print circulation is decreasing and we all know this. My job is to play a part in reinventing the wheel, thinking innovatively and creating imaginatively to stay top of mind. What do you hope to bring to the publication, and where do you plan to take it? There&#x2019;s only one way to describe it and that&#x2019;s into the future! What will be at the top of your to-do list when you start? Top of my radar right now is the September issue, which will be my first edition. What do you love most about your career? I love the dynamism and fast pace thinking that my career demands, being agile and creatively challenged really drives me. Cosmopolitan is a best friend for the fun, fearless female and it&#x2019;s up to us to deliver her everything she needs to live her best life. Cosmo South Africa reached 12-million users via social media in the last six months alone &#x2013; being tasked to grow that footprint further is in itself a massive privilege. How does it feel to have achieved your dream at such a young age? I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s quite sunk in yet! I&#x2019;m thrilled, motivated, humbled and ready. What are you currently reading/listening to for work? Sza &#x2013; she&#x2019;s just released her debut album Ctrl and it&#x2019;s fantastic. Also, I&#x2019;m a sucker for trashy chick-lits and I&#x2019;m not ashamed of it one bit! Tell us something about yourself not generally known? I lived in India for over a year and worked in Bollywood &#x2013; it was one of those life-changing chapters and help shaped who I am today.
