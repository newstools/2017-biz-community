She indicated that currently, 1,729 hectares of land are under production in the region, of which 1,453 hectares are at Aussenkehr where most Namibian table grapes come from. This figure is expected to increase to more than 2,200 hectares by the end of this year, which will also result in increased income. "During the financial year 2015/16 the total export value of table grapes was estimated at N$666m, which is estimated to reach N$1b by the end of 2017," she said. Although excited at the huge potential of the grape industry, the Kharas political head expressed disappointment in the lack of value addition to Namibian grapes. She said that adding value by producing grape juice and wine can create more jobs, and "this should be an area that should be explored". She also expressed concern over the deplorable living conditions of grape workers in general and particularly those at Aussenkehr, noting that residents live in squalid conditions in reed houses and still use the open veld when nature calls, which she said should not be the scenario for the booming industry. "Their living conditions have been an eyesore to every head of state who has ever visited the area," she said. She said in an effort to rectify the situation, the Kharas Regional Council entered a public-private partnership (PPP) with three companies that will assist in developing the area and once completed, Aussenkehr will be able to accommodate 40,000 residents in modern housing, with access to schools, shopping malls and medical facilities.
