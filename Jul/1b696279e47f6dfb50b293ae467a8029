What do you love about your industry? There are a few things: Any job has its &#x201c;cool&#x201d; and &#x201c;not so cool&#x201d; moments; and I love the people, that feeling of being part of something only a handful people know about or see until it gets released to the world on TV or the internet. 6. Describe your average work day, if such a thing exists. There&#x2019;s not much average to my day, but I generally work on projects when the sun is out, and on admin when the moon is out. 7. What are the tools of your trade? My brain! Haha! Ears: I need to hear; and my computer, without that we&#x2019;ll need to go back to tape! 8. Who is getting it right in your industry? There are many talented people doing great work! 9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. Paying suppliers on time! 10. What are you working on right now?

What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack it? Make friends and share. I&#x2019;d rather have 10% of a company that makes R100,000 than 100% of a company that makes R100. Simple as that.
