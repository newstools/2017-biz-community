Suna VenterShe was one of eight journalists wrongfully suspended by the SABC for challenging its unlawful interference and illegal editorial policies, and those closest to her believe that her condition was exacerbated, if not caused, by the events of the past year. Venter was assaulted on three separate occasions. She was "the victim of continued intimidation&#x201a; victimisation and death threats&#x201a;" her family said in a statement (embedded below). &#x201c;Over the course of the past year, she received various threatening SMS messages. Her flat was broken into on numerous occasions, the brake cables of her car were cut and her car&#x2019;s tyres were slashed. She was shot at and abducted &#x2013; tied to a tree at Melville Koppies while the grass around her was set alight.&#x201d; The SABC&#x2019;s executive producer Foeta Krige said Venter was passionate about international news and current affairs, and Syria in particular. &#x201c;She cared so much about the situation in Syria that she took leave right after the war began to report for RSG from the frontlines&#x201a;&#x201d; said Krige. &#x201c;She remained passionate about the welfare of the children she encountered on these assignments&#x201a; up until her death.&#x201d; Her mission was to establish an independent newsroom, free from editorial interference within the embattled public broadcaster, reported BusinessLive. On receiving medical advice to leave her stressful working environment, she apparently replied that she "cannot go before the battle is won".
