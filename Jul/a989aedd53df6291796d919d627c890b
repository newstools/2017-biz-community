 Kristaps Eberlins 123RF.comIn South Africa, &#x2018;strike action&#x2019; has become a metaphor for &#x2018;violent outbursts against all authority&#x2019;, as striking employees do not abide by the rules. With a single-minded focus to disrupt business and productivity, these employees can do irreparable damage if they are not contained. According to Kyle Condon, MD at D & K Management Consultants, companies must have an efficient strike preparedness security plan in place. &#x201c;Unions are defined by how violent and intimidating their members are &#x2013; in this country, that is often how they measure their success. Without an adequate, up to date strike contingency plan, companies become an easy target for intimidation and vandalism.&#x201d; He believes that strike protection goes further than a standard security function, confirming that it requires the best in skill and mental competence. Lack of regard for property Last year&#x2019;s #FeesMustFall action, the recent taxi strikes, violence against Uber drivers and a general lack of regard for property (public or private) illustrate the need for protection. The Intelligence Bureau of South Africa reported on the protest action occurring on 26 June 2017, stating &#x201c;Benoni protest disrupts Actonville and Benoni CBD, protestors turn violent and damage everything in their path.&#x201d; With the Metal and Engineering Industries Bargaining Council (MEIBC) strike expected to begin in July this year, businesses will be left vulnerable if protection strategies have not been implemented. &#x201c;A lack of planning and preparedness, coupled with the misinformed belief that the police will stop any criminal action, has exposed unprepared businesses to massive losses,&#x201d; confirms Jacki Condon, md of Apache Security Services. &#x201c;Active violence and active intimidation are definitely scenarios that must be prepared because it is too late when a mob has already formed in front of your business.&#x201d; Three elements in strike protection There are three elements to strike protection, each carrying significant weight in ensuring that the business, its staff and its assets are protected. A tailor-made pre-strike planning guide should be developed, considering the specific business&#x2019; risks, evaluating the company&#x2019;s readiness for strike action, and providing solutions to secure the premises and the people that work on it. The second element is the deployment of skilled strike protection teams, in the event of a strike or protest. These teams guard South African businesses during labour unrest, providing real protection against vandalism, physical assault, property invasion and intimidation. &#x201c;The teams should be equipped with crowd control skills, displaying expertise in lawfully dealing with hostile and violent protestors,&#x201d; adds Kyle. The third and final element is a post-strike report, which provides documented evidence obtained during the strike. &#x201c;Specialist hostile video recording operatives, for example, provide hard video evidence against those that break the law,&#x201d; says Jacki. &#x201c;This ensures that those striking will be held accountable, should they engage in any act deemed as illegal or criminal.&#x201d; With access to direct intelligence from inside the striking group, via deployed infiltration agents, this information assists businesses to run disciplinary hearings, or drive criminal proceedings, while providing valuable insights to apply to future strategies. According to Kyle, a sound strike plan should call for the creation of a Strike Task Committee. The physical weaknesses in the perimeter should be identified and solutions provided, and contact must be made with local SAPS and emergency services. &#x201c;Safe zones should be identified, picketing zones demarcated to the business&#x2019; advantage (taking the legal framework into consideration), and continuity plans put in place. Strike protection units must be on call, and clearly defined engagement rules and methods should be laid out.&#x201d; Jacki adds that VIP protection should be considered for priority staff that may become the target of intimidation, and vehicle or truck escorts should be employed. &#x201c;The plan should also define the scope of the existing security contractors during the strike, determine when and how video evidence will be captured, and state the arrival times of contract staff, to ensure their safety. To ensure the safety of non-striking staff, alternative operating hours could be considered, and staff should be made aware of the laws of self-defence and the liability of personal firearms during the strikes.&#x201d; The three overarching goals of strike protection are to save lives, protect property and safeguard the business&#x2019; reputation. &#x201c;The question is, &#x2018;Does your company have an efficient strike preparedness security plan?&#x2019;&#x201d; concludes Kyle.
