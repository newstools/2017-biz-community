Cape Town agencies brought home 12 of the 27 Lions handed to South African agencies during the week-long awards festival; the other 15 are gracing trophy cabinets in Johannesburg. FCB Cape Town itself, which won three Lions, was one of the agencies contributing to the Mother City&#x2019;s haul. &#x201c;Well done to all whose work was recognised in Cannes, especially those whose work translated from shortlist status to win metal. The standard this year was incredibly high,&#x201d; said FCB Cape Town Executive Creative Director, Mike Barnwell. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d also like to give a huge shout out to the Mother City agencies which accounted for 45% of the Lions awarded to South Africa.&#x201d; In addition to taking the number two spot on the Cape Town Cannes ranking, with its two Silver Lions and one Bronze Lion, FCB Cape Town is this year&#x2019;s best performing radio agency in the FCB global network. FCB and its network of affiliates around the world had a stellar week in Cannes bringing home 45 Lions at the 2017 Festival, four Gold, 19 Silver and 22 Bronze medals. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re obviously exceptionally proud to contribute to that tally making us this year&#x2019;s best performing FCB agency in the radio category. Two other agencies in the network also won in the category, both taking Bronze Lions,&#x201d; said Barnwell. &#x201c;FCB Cape Town has won at Cannes in a variety of different categories over the past few years &#x2013; print, radio, online, outdoor and promotion &#x2013; which demonstrates our strength in various disciplines and talks to our ability to work through the line,&#x201d; added Managing Director, Eric D&#x2019;Oliveira &#x201c;We believe the FCB Cape Town story is one of consistency, and our outings at Cannes &#x2013; where we regularly bring home metal &#x2013; proves this.&#x201d; Barnwell concluded: &#x201c;Most importantly though, our performance at Cannes has helped FCB Africa maintain a healthy national creative ranking, according to the Creative Circle.&#x201d; Bizcommunity search: Cannes Lions content in Biz Google news search: Cannes Lions on Google News Twitter search: https://twitter.com/search?q=CannesLions Official site: http://www.canneslions.com, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram More info: Cannes Lions special section</li></li></li></li>
