Weebi has designed a point of sale (PoS) solution made out of aluminium with a 3D printer within. It comes pre-installed with a 3G Android tablet integrating the Weebi app. The app works offline and provides confidential backup, allowing shopkeepers to quicken client registration, ease invoicing and print tickets. Weebi also provides a live data analysis tool &#x2013; the Weebi Bot &#x2013; allowing shopkeepers to better monitor business activity. Co-founder Pierre Gancel told Disrupt Africa Weebi was about to deploy to 50 shops in Dakar and had established relationships with subcontractors in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Gabon, Angola and Ethiopia. &#x201c;Our key landmark is to provide data analysis to microentrepreneurs in Dakar, allowing them to manage their business better. They use the Weebi app to get clear insight and forecasts,&#x201d; he said. This expansion has been made possible via a US$30,000 grant from Agence Fran aise de D velopement, with Gancel saying the point of subcontractor arrangements is to save cash and distribute more widely.
