Nul Is Nie Niks Nie The impressive Afrikaans film, Nul Is Nie Niks Nie is a heart-warming coming-of-age story about life, death and everything in between.

Drikus&#x2019; love of life and determination brings the surrounding lifeless community together and gives them a new lease on life. Liz Vosloo wrote the screenplay for this film, inspired by the youth drama, Oor &#x2019;n motorfiets, &#x2019;n zombiefiek en lang getalle wat deur elf gedeel kan word by Jaco Jacobs. ''My vision is for the film to become a piece of cinema that will have a long life because of its theme of life and death, which is central to the story, says director Morn du Toit. ''We were loyal to the theme from the beginning and I hope the film reaches a broad audience that will find it inspiring to watch. I believe that stories have the ability to change lives, to bring hope where there was none, and life to where there was none.'' Spider-Man: Homecoming Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, young Peter Parker (Tom Holland) returns home to live with his Aunt May in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Under the watchful eye of mentor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Parker starts to embrace his newfound identity as Spider-Man. He also tries to return to his normal daily routine &#x2013; distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just a friendly neighbourhood superhero. Peter must soon put his powers to the test when the evil Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges to threaten everything that he holds dear. His moment has arrived as he is challenged to become the hero he is meant to be. It is the second reboot of the Spider-Man film franchise and the sixteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Jon Watts (Clown, Cop Car), with a screenplay by the writing teams of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. For producer and Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, bringing the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in an original way that film audiences have never seen before was a top priority. &#x201c;Over the past 15 years, we have built the Marvel Cinematic Universe with so many characters and movies, and now we have the opportunity to introduce Peter Parker and the Spider-Man franchise into that universe for the first time,&#x201d; says Feige. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s exciting because that&#x2019;s how he truly was in the comics, from the very beginning &#x2013; he didn&#x2019;t enter the comics as the only hero; he entered a world in which Tony Stark, Captain America and the Avengers all were there. And now, for the first time, we get that in an entire film, which makes it fresh and new.&#x201d; Churchill Churchill follows Britain&#x2019;s iconic Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Brian Cox) in the days before the infamous D&#x2010;Day landings in June 1944.
