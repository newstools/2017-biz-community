In Gaborone, Botswana, the company has identified seven such nodes, where points of interest converge to attract a high number of consumers. Game City Shopping Mall, one of the busiest &#x2018;super malls&#x2019; in Gaborone, is located at the confluence of major roads from Lobatse, Kgale View and Naledi, and surrounded by Gaborone West industrial area office parks and residential area. The shopping centre and surrounds serves as Gaborone&#x2019;s second largest economic hub. About 51% of the blue and white-collar businesses in Gaborone are situated within its vicinity and the mall is accessible to audiences from across the income spectrum. It hosts several annual events, including Christmas carols and the Game City Half Marathon. At present, Game City occupies 51,000 m , with another two phases of approximately 8,000 m underway to extend, refresh and improve the centre&#x2019;s overall offering. More than 120 stores are housed in the mall, including banks, grocery stores, lifestyle retail and restaurants, as well as telecoms service providers such as Mascom, Orange and Samsung. Having identified the mall as a key node for Gaborone, Primedia Outdoor has established a range of messaging opportunities both within and outside the mall, from light boxes and pillar wraps in the parking area to street poles and wall sites. &#x201c;Once our research identifies an area as an important node, we will seek to establish advertising opportunities there for our clients,&#x201d; says Johan Haupt, marketing services manager for Primedia Outdoor Rest of Africa. &#x201c;As an important commercial hub, Game City Mall is, therefore, a key site in our Gaborone offering.&#x201d; Primedia Outdoor covers the remaining six large convergence nodes in Gaborone with over 40 panels.
