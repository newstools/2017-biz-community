It assesses top brands from nine industries and their performance when it comes to keeping consumers happy - or letting them down. These include brands in fast food, life insurance, cellular handsets, full service restaurants, banking, supermarkets, short-term insurance, wireless internet providers and municipalities. According to Consulta, the top five overall brands in the country are dominated by fast food chains with Debonairs Pizza leading the pack: Debonairs &#x2013; 85.0 Nando&#x2019;s &#x2013; 83.8 Apple &#x2013; 83.5 McDonald&#x2019;s &#x2013; 83.2 Capitec Bank &#x2013; 83.1</li></li></li></li>In addition, Debonairs Pizza was one of two biggest movers for the year with its SAcsi score jumping 3.9 points to 85.0. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re delighted with our performance, as our franchisees have been focused on delivering quality service and great value for consumers who, given the depressed economy, are rewarding themselves more often with a delicious Debonairs Pizza as opposed to more expensive purchases, or who are working late to make ends meet and need the convenience of a fun and satisfying meal at the end of a hard day,&#x201d; said Marketing Executive Toni Joubert. &#x201c;We also believe our communication with our consumers, driven by FCB Joburg, is helping us talk in the right tone, and uses the correct verbal and visual clues that contribute to a mutually respectful relationship between the brand and the Debonairs Pizza fan. &#x201c;The agency has a reputation for winning over the hearts of minds of its client&#x2019; target markets and we certainly see the positive link between our advertising and our customer engagement,&#x201d; she said. Proof of the agency&#x2019;s ability to create much liked advertising, and Debonairs Pizza&#x2019;s determination to weave good-hearted, family-style humour into its communication, also recently paid off with a top spot on Kantar Millward Brown&#x2019;s Most-Liked television commercials list for the third quarter of 2016. Taking pole position on the list was &#x2018;Gogo Crammed Crust&#x2019;, created by FCB Joburg and shot at a popular picnic spot for Joburgers, Rhodes Park.
