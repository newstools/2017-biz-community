A British furniture company, Timothy Oulton is renowned for its luxury and dramatic collections, including handcrafted leather furniture, unique lighting pieces and home accessories. &#x201c;This is an exciting addition to our offering. I have been a fan of the range for many years and am delighted to enhance its presence within our stores with a dedicated showroom in Fourways. The synergy between the two brands has been instrumental in making this decision," said Chris Weylandt. "We share the same ideals of furniture being of the highest quality, bold and timeless and an unrelenting drive to deliver a world-class customer experience in-store. I think the Johannesburg market is ready for something different, this is definitely it.&#x201d; The opening of the Johannesburg gallery marks the next step in Timothy Oulton&#x2019;s expansion.
