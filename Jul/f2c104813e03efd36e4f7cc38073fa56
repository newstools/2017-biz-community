Clients can now opt to display the time it will take a consumer to travel from where they engaged with the banner and landing page, to the actual real-world location. Vicinity Media CEO Daryl van Arkel comments, &#x201c;Vicinity Media is an industry-leading 'click-to-brick' platform. Time to Location strengthens this ability to push consumers in store. Market feedback has told us that many consumers, in both South Africa and the Middle East, prefer &#x2018;Time to Location&#x2019; so we&#x2019;ve built the feature in response to their feedback.&#x201d;
