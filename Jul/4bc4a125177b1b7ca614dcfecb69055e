 Francis Dean via 123RFTo celebrate, Ford developed a special version of the new Focus RS Option Pack for the 2017 Tour de France. Sporting a striking new white livery that matches Team Sky&#x2019;s special edition Tour de France jerseys, the Focus RS Option Pack will lead Team Sky&#x2019;s fleet for the tour, which started on 1 July 2017 in Dusseldorf, Germany. The fleet also includes white liveried Ford Mondeo wagons featuring Ford Intelligent All Wheel Drive (AWD), as well as S-MAX, Edge and Transit vehicles, which Team Sky has been using since the partnership was first announced at the start of 2016. Since then the team has enjoyed 51 wins with the cars covering more than 40,000 kilometres.
