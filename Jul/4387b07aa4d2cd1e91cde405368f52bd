Two commercials filmed in Cape Town will be aired globally to show Garmin's new line of multi-sport GPS training smart watches, the f&#x0113;nix 5 series... &#x201c;We want to capitalise on the wearable momentum with this new campaign,&#x201d; said VP of Marketing, Susan Lyman. &#x201c;The f&#x0113;nix 5 series is for those who live an active life and want to make the most of every waking hour of the day. That&#x2019;s who we&#x2019;re speaking to.&#x201d; The Garmin US team identified Cape Town for commercial production due to its long daylight hours and diversity of great locations in and around Cape Town. Both commercials were filed over a five-day period, often with three to four locations per day. The f&#x0113;nix 5 watch capabilities vary across multiple sporting platforms, coupled with a sophisticated style factor, so the commercials had to show this. A series of quick cuts made up the montage that followed a person from the beginning to the end of the day. In &#x201c;Monday&#x201d;, we watch a man seize every minute of the day, going from morning workout, to business power meeting, to epic trail run. The spot ends with the f&#x0113;nix 5-wielding hero walking confidently into a crowded subway station to pursue his next challenge. &#x201c;Today only comes once,&#x201d; he opines. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s to those who take that as a threat, and crush it.&#x201d; The film resolves to the campaign line of &#x201c;Beat Yesterday&#x201d; and reveals the Garmin wearable device in all its glory. &#x201c;This is an aspirational film,&#x201d; said Garmin VP of Creative and Communications, Brian Brooker. &#x201c;We want people to watch this and say &#x2018;I want to be that guy, I want a f&#x0113;nix 5 from Garmin.&#x2019;&#x201d; A second film showcases the compact, lighter weight watch in the series. In &#x201c;Saturday&#x201d; we watch an equally emboldened woman &#x2018;beat yesterday&#x2019; with the f&#x0113;nix 5S. The commercials are part of a 360-degree campaign that will also consist of digital, social media, print and out-of-home executions in about 20 of Garmin&#x2019;s global markets, including the US, UK, Germany, France and South Africa. &#x201c;The TV commercials kicked off in May and were strategically placed to complement the f&#x0113;nix 5 watch capabilities (airing on SuperSport and DStv lifestyle shows), supported with a strong OOH strategy including traditional billboards as well as dynamic content. Digital focussed on performance marketing, social media and partner platforms, while key print publications were selected and in store partnerships with our dealers to end off the customer journey,&#x201d; comments Jenna Chisnall, Marcomms Manager Sub-Saharan Africa. &#x201c;It took five days of filming, multiple challenging locations, temperamental weather, over 200 crew, and a lengthy prop and wardrobe list, to make these epic commercials. The Garmin f&#x0113;nix 5 TV commercials were truly the most exciting I have been part of, and definitely one of the most rewarding to work alongside the Garmin US team.&#x201d; ends Chisnall.
