Independent analyst Syd Vianello said the retail picture was unlikely to improve in the near term as consumers in all brackets were taking strain. Commenting on H&M's group results, CEO Karl-Johan Persson said fashion retail was going through a period of extensive change because of increased digitalisation. In the six months to May, H&M group sales rose 9%. "Customer behaviour and expectations are changing at an ever-increasing pace, with a greater and greater share of sales taking place online. This shift brings great opportunities for the group," said Persson. "We are in a strong position, with well-known global brands suited to both physical stores and online sales. We are financially strong and can invest at the pace required," he said.
