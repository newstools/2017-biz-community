The mobile platform serves more than 26 million customers in the country. According to the company, the upgrade will reduce the need for customers to make requests to its call centre and reduce the time that new partners take to be integrated onto the M-Pesa system from weeks to a few hours. Safaricom said it looks to deploy new features and services over the coming months. Among the new features that customers can look forward to including M-Shwari and KCB M-Pesa implementation in the Safaricom App. As a result of the changeover M-Pesa customers were unable to transact on the service for two hours on June 30 beginning 1am to 3am and services will not be available again on July 5 at a similar time.
