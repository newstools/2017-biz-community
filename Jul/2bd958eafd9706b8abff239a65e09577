Exciting work came from unexpected places and if the Fringe reflects the state of the performing arts in the country, it is bold, vibrant and angry.&#x201d; said Tracey Saunders, convenor of the 2017 panel, also noting that the range of work on offer was diverse &#x2013; from delicate, solo work to large, chaotic ensembles and several permutations in between.
