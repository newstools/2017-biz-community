 Lukas Gojda 123RF.comThe Emerging Contractors Conference, courtesy of Black Suppliers in partnership with PPC, aims to assist entrepreneurs with information on how to improve their businesses; how to identify and pitch for new business opportunities; equip them with the right skills to improve existing skills and provide a networking platform between startups, big corporates and service providers. Skills sharing &#x201c;As a business, we are extremely delighted to be a part of the inaugural emerging contractors conference in Soweto. This is an opportunity for us to engage with SMMEs and emerging contractors, allowing us to impart our skills, expertise and knowledge. Part of why we are involved with this event is because we believe that we can be partners to the emerging contractors. We have been around for 125 years and believe that the legacy and experience gained over this period really demonstrates how the work we have done is of great quality. We believe that longevity is important and that is why we want to partner with companies or people who believe in the same thing as we do,&#x201d; says Rob Rein, PPC executive for sales and marketing. The conference seeks to drive transformation in the construction industry and the development of small-, medium- and micro-sized enterprise (SMME) contractors, which have been recognised by government and business as crucial for industry development, economic growth, job creation and poverty alleviation. It will also offer emerging SMME contractors the opportunity to learn about the latest available materials and technologies; develop soft and hard skills, as well as participate in competitions and prize giveaways.
