 Liu Junrong 123RF.comIn supporting Level 4b restrictions, the city requires all water users to immediately use less than 87 litres of water per person per day in total, irrespective of whether you are at home, work or elsewhere. "As we are expecting a very dry summer 2018 and rainfall probability and volume remain incredibly uncertain, we must cut our water use even more to save as much water as we can while we still have water. We ask all users to use less than 87 litres of water per person per day in total whether you are at home, work, school or elsewhere. Importantly, this target is not only for home use. "This is part of our continuing proactive drought management interventions, along with intensifying the large-scale pressure reduction programmes across Cape Town to force down consumption. Other emergency interventions are under way. "However, there are many domestic consumers who are still using well in excess of 20,000 litres per month per household. We have been monitoring and engaging with high users and we will be issuing letters to them to warn them that we will be installing water management devices at properties with unjustifiably high consumption to limit their water use to acceptable levels," said the city&#x2019;s mayoral committee member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services; and Energy, Councillor Xanthea Limberg. Residents can contact the city via email to az.vog.nwotepac&#64;retaw for queries or to report contraventions of the water restrictions (evidence should be provided to assist the city&#x2019;s enforcement efforts), or they can send an SMS to 31373.
