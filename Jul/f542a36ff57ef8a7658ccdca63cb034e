Recorded and produced by Theo Crous at the now popular and renowned Belville Studios in Cape Town and with the assistance of Robert James Davidson (keyboard and synth for Zebra & Giraffe) Kahn has taken a slightly different direction for this album, which he describes, rather tongue in cheek, as a smorgasbord of gospel alternative 80&#x2019;s POP from the future. The bi-weekly release of singles and videos from A Noise In The Void has afforded fans the opportunity to experience a taste of what to expect from the album. Writing process Kahn explains the writing process behind the album, saying &#x201c;The writing process is a continuous process, on this album there's a few songs where I collaborated with other song writers; Karen Zoid, Nic Olsen and Tristan Prettyman. Both Tristan and Karen's songs also became duets. Musically both Theo Crous and Rob Davidson were integral contributors across the entire album and I featured one of my The Voice, season 1 team contestants, Eden Myrrh on many tracks, including a duet.&#x201d; On recording the album, the process was a timeous one for Kahn who used various musicians to create his own sound. &#x201c;The songs were recorded with Theo Crous at Bellville studios over several sessions in between touring and life's commitments. I used several session musicians to ensure a significant departure from The Parlotones sound.&#x201d; When asking Kahn what his favourite track on the album is, he responds &#x201c;It&#x2019;s difficult to choose a favourite, I love them all for different reasons. I'm chuffed with my guitar work on Vacancy and I love the musicality of Goodbye Annie. The message on Cupid and Fables is important but I'm proud of how the entire album turned out.&#x201d; A special message from Kahn to all his fans as they listen to &#x2018;A Noise In The Void&#x2019; - &#x201c;I hope fans enjoy the journey of the album, and embrace some of the philosophy within the script and the lyrics. Musicians always hope for some semblance of success with their creations BUT mostly I hope to look back one day and be proud of this album and look forward to bringing it to fans on a soon to be announced series of dates.&#x201d; Tour dates Catch Kahn and Karen Zoid live at the following remaining dates of the We Could Be Divine tour: Venue: Sand Du Plessis Theatre, Bloemfontein Date: Tuesday, 18 July 2017 Booking: Computicket &#x2013; Sold Out Venue: Teatro Montecasino Date: Friday, 21 July 2017 and Saturday, 22 July 2017 Booking: Computicket (Friday, 21 July Sold Out / 22 July &#x2013; Tickets Available) Kahn&#x2019;s album &#x2018;A Noise In The Void&#x2019; is out now on digital release through Gallo Record Company.
