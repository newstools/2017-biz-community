The campaign was created to advertise the calming benefits of Biral, a mild natural tranquiliser and positions Biral as the hero in everyday situations where mild anxiety can quickly spiral out of control, stepping in to restore control and ultimately save the day. The radio spots depict how one seemingly innocuous moment of anxiety - such as an exam, or a driving test - can spiral out of control, as one thought collides with another, resulting in the breathlessness of irrational panic. "I think the winning radio spot really illustrates the clever use of narrative mode in a well-scripted radio ad campaign - and ultimately illustrates the power and relevance of radio in this digital age," explains Group Executive Creative Director Gareth McPherson. "The success of the advert is really a result of our team&#x2019;s ability to produce authentic radio commercials that land the message. In this case, the well-crafted script, witty writing and carefully controlled pace combined to create a campaign that we believe has the potential to become an award-winning brand story," he concludes. https://soundcloud.com/publicis-machine/1-biral-radio-gym-boy-v002
