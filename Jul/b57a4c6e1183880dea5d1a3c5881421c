&#x201c;Our recent collaboration with Travelstart resulted not only in record-breaking customer registrations, increases in traffic and time browsing TFG sites, but also engagement on our social platforms, which expanded our communities,&#x201d; says Robyn Cooke, head of e-commerce at TFG. Traffic to the TFG shopping sites increased around 8% as a direct result of this partnership. The collaboration gave online shoppers the opportunity to win a trip for two to London including flights, accommodation and a R10,000 tfg.co.za voucher to spend on items for the trip. TFG also collaborated with SA Florist on a &#x2018;We really, really like you&#x2019; Valentine&#x2019;s Day campaign, and more recently with Cybercellar in the lead up to Father&#x2019;s Day, with shoppers eligible to win beer for their dad for a year. &#x201c;These campaigns expose the online TFG product offering to a wider audience through innovative experiences and exciting offers, providing customers with wider choice, better value and more convenience. The campaigns are also a two-way street, with our partners also seeing great results in terms of revenue, traffic and social engagement.&#x201d; TFG and SA Florist partner to encourage customers to say thank youIsn't it time to say thank you?

While driving revenue is a leading objective, watching customers engage with group brands in ways never before seen has been the most surprising outcome.
