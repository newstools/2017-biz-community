Forbes Woman Africa has won a Silver Award in the Best Feature category (for its story on refugees in South Africa, &#x2018;The Nowhere People&#x2019;); and was placed 7th in the Top 25 Best Single Issue category for the overall content of its August/September 2016 edition that featured Africa&#x2019;s Blue Economy on the cover. Judges commented: &#x201c;This photo-driven human-interest feature on South Africa&#x2019;s displaced refugees creatively taps into emotional interviews with three women from Zimbabwe and combines them with a layout using a single pop of color, red, to push a powerful message. The message is one of demoralization and desperation, while eloquently pressing for address of a worldwide crisis: the 65.3 million people who have nowhere to call home.&#x201d; South Africa&#x2019;s Leadership magazine was a Bronze winner, coming third overall, in the Best Single Issue: Top 25 Issues category. Forbes Woman Africa placed seventh and The Afropolitan, was placed 10th, in the same category. Judges comment on Leadership&#x2019;s win: &#x201c;Leadership has eye-catching, cohesive artwork and well-thought out copy. The writing is as stunning as the graphics.&#x201d; Said Methil Renuka, editor of Forbes Woman Africa: &#x201c;To receive editorial and design recognition in two categories, for Best Feature and Best Single Issue, is humbling indeed. Being recognised for overall content by some of the best editors in the world, tells me that we are doing something right, and there is respect for the high editorial standards we uphold.&#x201d; Presented by Trade, Association and Business Publications International (TABPI), the editorial and design competition, in its 14th year, was open to English-language B2B publications worldwide published at least three times per year. TABPI President Paul J. Heney commented on the achievements this year: &#x201c;We saw a great deal of changes this year in the patterns of who was entering what,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We saw more publications entering in certain categories, such as Best Single Issue. The judging was particularly tough there, and there were areas where multiple publications were very close in scoring. As a result, there are some fresh faces in our listings this year, which was very inspiring to see.&#x201d; For more on the Tabbie awards, visit: http://www.tabpi.org.
