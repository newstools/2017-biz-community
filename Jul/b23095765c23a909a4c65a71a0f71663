Made in small volumes with creative flair exclusively for the auction by the Guild&#x2019;s members, these wines will go under the hammer in Stellenbosch on Saturday, 30 September. Over and above the sought after 2017 auction wines, the members of the Guild will also be representing some of their flagship offerings sold under their own labels. Showcase-goers will have the opportunity to contribute towards the Nedbank Cape Winemakers Guild Development Trust by bidding on rare signed bottles from previous Guild auctions during the Silent Auction. Founded in 1999, the Development Trust seeks to sustain the health of the wine industry by educating, training and empowering young talent through initiatives such as the Prot g Programme, a highly acclaimed mentorship scheme for upcoming winemakers and viticulturists.
