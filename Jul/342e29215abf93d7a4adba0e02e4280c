The online campaign, &#x201c;Pre-Joy&#x201d;, for Cadbury, through agency Ogilvy JHB, has already won awards at last year&#x2019;s Loeries and this years D&AD awards. &#x201c;It was based on a simple but brilliant idea,&#x201d; Adam Howard says, &#x201c;The creative team selected several viral online clips and created a series of 5&#x201d; pre-rolls that appear as if they are actually part of the original videos. We had to make sure our upfront audio exactly matched the subsequent content &#x2013; a tricky task as the audio quality on the Youtube clips was terrible! We spent hours crafting the audio to match the low-grade sound. It really was a challenge.&#x201d; A huge team effort - the project was shot by Bomb Commercials - directed by Tebogo Malope - with post-production completed by MOI Content. http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/111/163765.html Bizcommunity search: Cannes Lions content in Biz Google news search: Cannes Lions on Google News Twitter search: https://twitter.com/search?q=CannesLions Official site: http://www.canneslions.com, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram More info: Cannes Lions special section</li></li></li></li>
