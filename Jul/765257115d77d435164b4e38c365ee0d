Bongani Bingwa's reaction to the #SASSA briefing. Image: Twitter.comHe told TshisaLIVE that he had been "shadowing" Tlhabi for a while and was excited but "nervous" about the opportunity. "As it happens, this is not the first time I am taking over from Redi. In some ways, I have been chasing her shadow for a long time. She's a doyenne of the industry. Smart, sincere, tough as nails and highly principled. I will be learning from her for years to come," he said. Ten years ago Tim Modise left and Tlhabi took over the afternoon drive show. Bingwa then took over from Tlhabi to become the host of Talk at Nine. Tlhabi announced in May that she would be leaving the station after 12 years. She is taking up a fellowship in the US. Tlhabi highlighted the importance of journalism in her farewell note. "Primedia and 702, in particular, have played a crucial role in the evolution of our democracy and consistently given a voice to the voiceless. "The commitment to the country and exercise of independent, hardhitting but fair journalism make me very proud to have been part of this great institution," she said. Social media was not ready to let go of the popular presenter and on her last day flooded Twitter with a series of memes and well-wishes. Bingwa added that Tlhabi had indirectly prepared him for when he officially steps into the hot seat. He said he had received tremendous support from a lot of people and was looking forward to bringing his uniqueness to the show. "I think I have a sense of inquisitiveness and fun that will hopefully make the drive home an interesting and absorbing one for listeners. "I want to host a show that unpacks the events of the day from every sphere. I hope the show will be the preferred choice for anyone keen to know what happened on any given day," he said. He officially takes over the helm on Monday.
