According to a report on CNBC, Gavin O'Gorman, an investigator with U.S. antivirus firm Symantec, said in a blog post: "There may be a more nefarious motive behind the attack. Perhaps this attack was never intended to make money (but) rather to simply disrupt a large number of Ukrainian organisations." A growing consensus among security researchers, armed with technical evidence, suggests the main purpose of the attack was to install new malware on computers at government and commercial organisations in Ukraine, says a report on Reuters. Rather than extortion, the goal may be to plant the seeds of future sabotage, experts said. Ukrainian politicians were quick to blame Russia for the attack, but a Kremlin spokesman dismissed "unfounded blanket accusations".
