&#x201c;We have improved our warranty and service plans to be both easy to understand and as comprehensive as possible. The extension signals the successful completion of the project,&#x201d; says Andr Venter, divisional head for sales and marketing at Suzuki South Africa. The new mechanical warranty will guarantee the perfect operation of every Suzuki and will cover all costs in the case of a mechanical failure, barring failures resulting from abuse, a lack of scheduled maintenance, or a vehicle accident. &#x201c;In making sure we offer the most benefit to our customers, we have extended our partnership with the Automobile Association (AA) to offer five-years of free roadside assistance,&#x201d; says Venter. The partnership with the AA will extend beyond its breakdown service and include services such as help with changing a flat tyre, jump starting a flat battery, and car lock-out support, emergency fuel, and even telephonic directions. The AA will also relay messages to your friends and family in the case of an emergency.
