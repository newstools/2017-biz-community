Says Niessen: &#x201c;The response to the call for nominations has been overwhelming when considering the numbers from previous programs. Europe&#x2019;s first Inspiring Fifty yielded a selection of just over 500 women, so we are more than pleased with the South African pool. &#x201c;We are excited about all these women who have been given the opportunity to create awareness of their roles in the technology and innovation sectors and encourage more women to join the force.&#x201d;
