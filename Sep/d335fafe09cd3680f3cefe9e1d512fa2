The Most Awards recognise and rank the service efficacy of South African-based media owner sales teams and their media agency partners to ultimately motivate them to improve the efficacy of their businesses through service performance. Sandra Gordon Sandra Gordon, CEO of Iconic Group and founder of the Most Awards opened the ceremony by giving a brief introduction to what the Most Awards are really all about and what they indicate regarding the industry this year. "The Most Awards doesn&#x2019;t set the trends, but certainly the stability, independence and veracity of the research can give very clear indications of where sales teams and media agency frontline staff are performing or not performing. It reflects this year an industry in flux. There are massive differences in the rankings this year, both in agencies and owners. However, there&#x2019;s no doubt that media-agency and -owner teams continue to exceed expectations ... they build up their game, stand up and stand up for the rest of the sheep &#x2013; that&#x2019;s what this is all about, people who stand up and make a difference for the companies and themselves."
