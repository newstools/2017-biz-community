 PixabayThe Youth Achiever Award is presented to an industry newcomer or young individual who has demonstrated excellence in his or her craft, and is one of a number of discretionary awards to be included in the presentations. The winner will be announced during the awards event to be staged over two evenings, on 16 and 18 March in Sun City, with a live broadcast on SABC 2. Motheo Matsau, chief of marketing and sales of Ster-Kinekor Theatres, says, &#x201c;This is an exciting development for us. The SAFTAs provide another excellent avenue for us to demonstrate our commitment to the growing South African film industry. However, more importantly, we are delighted to be sponsoring a new and innovative category that recognises the rising stars of tomorrow. &#x201c;Focusing on growing the youth market is a key sector within our marketing strategy. This sponsorship opportunity further strengthens that strategy. It also gives us access to some of the exciting and developing talent within the sector, who are destined for future success.&#x201d; The SAFTAs, managed under the custodianship of the National Film and Video Foundation (NFVF), are an integral part of the growth, skills development and transformation aligned with the NFVF&#x2019;s goals for the industry. The awards honour, celebrate and promote the creativity, quality and excellence of the South African film and television talent and productions and serve to encourage entrepreneurship and the development of new talent within the industry. &#x201c;It is important that all sectors within the industry work together to ensure our continued commitment to the growth and success of the country&#x2019;s burgeoning film industry. Our partnership with the NFVF to sponsor the SAFTAs category that focuses on youth achievement is our commitment to ensuring a healthy pipeline talent and content into the future,&#x201d; concludes Matsau.
