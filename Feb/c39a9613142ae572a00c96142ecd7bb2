There is a possibility that corrosion of the wire harness connector pins in the Hydraulic ECU assembly can occur due to improper sealing of the Hydraulic ECU&#x2019;s wire harness connector cover. The Hydraulic ECU monitors individual wheel speeds and will, when determined, operate the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Electronic Stability Programme (ESP). If moisture contaminated with road salt reaches the Hydraulic ECU&#x2019;s circuit board, an electrical short circuit may occur on the circuit board. In some instances, the ESC or ABS warning light may illuminate. &#x201c;The safety of our vehicles and its owners is a priority for KIA,&#x201d; says David Sieff, marketing director, KIA Motors South Africa. &#x201c;Most of the reports about this problem have occurred in countries with heavy snowfall, where roads are regularly treated with salt to avoid ice forming on the road surface. It is the salt in the water content that could cause the corrosion. No such incidents have been reported in South Africa.&#x201d; For more, go to www.kia.co.za or call 010 596 2000.
