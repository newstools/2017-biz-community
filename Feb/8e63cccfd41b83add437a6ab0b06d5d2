It is also expected to contribute to the creation of 60,000 job opportunities over the medium term as well as better food security. According to the Absa Agricultural Outlook for 2017, the rand weakened as much as 29.4% during the first quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. This went together with price increases for staple products such as maize as well as low production volumes. It also helped contribute to the greater demand for vegetables, according to the study.
