An award-winning global smash hit phenomenon, Blue Man Group creates experiences that defy categorisation, taking the audience on a journey that is funny, intelligent and visually stunning. All this culminates in the trademark Blue Man Group finale - a blissful party atmosphere. Blue Man Group is accompanied by a live band whose tribal rhythms help drive the show to its unforgettable climax. The group&#x2019;s origins Blue Man Group was founded by three close friends Chris Wink, Matt Goldman and Phil Stanton in New York in 1991. Since the group&#x2019;s inception it has grown to include permanent shows in Las Vegas, New York, Orlando, Boston, Chicago and Berlin, as well as a North American Tour and a World Tour. Beyond the stage show, Blue Man Group has toured the globe with the &#x2018;Megastar World Tour&#x2019; rock concert parody, produced multiple albums, including the Grammy-nominated Audio, and the recently released THREE. They have also published their first ever book, Blue Man World, in October 2016. South African rave press reviews comment on the show&#x2019;s unique offering: &#x201c;They say seeing is believing and observing them in action at the Teatro, Montecasino, is a rare treat, an extraordinary journey where music, movement and striking examples of modern technology are brought to the boil and spilling over into an audience ready to accept something completely different&#x201d; &#x2013; Artslink &#x2013; Peter Feldmen &#x201c;I enjoyed how interactive the show is as several members of the audience, which included musician Danny K, got to join in the fun on stage&#x201d; &#x2013; Cape Times CEO of Big Concerts, Justin Van Wyk said &#x201c;We are extremely pleased with the reaction to Blue Man Group in Johannesburg.
