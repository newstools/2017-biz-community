The receptionist (who may or may not be Pretty Penny), not only gives him terrible, unsolicited advice on his car, but also weighs in on his &#x201c;eighties&#x201d;-looking tie&#x2026; "Being new to the market, the main task for the BestDrive brand is to build brand awareness,&#x201d; says Cathy Hutchinson, Marketing Manager, BestDrive. &#x201c;Even though tyre fitment is characterised by well established brands, opportunity presents itself to tap into the customer's need for advice from a trustworthy tyre sales consultant and then to have their new tyres fitted in an environment that instills confidence. By contrasting the dreadful experience received at Pretty Penny&#x2019;s Pit Stop with the great service at BestDrive, we hope to get people&#x2019;s attention so that when they are in the market for tyres they consider BestDrive&#x2026;" The memorable TVC flighted for the six weeks leading up to Christmas last year. It was supported by a radio ad and various point of sale materials. While research is still being conducted, anecdotal feedback from the TVC and social media commentary has been overwhelmingly positive - especially amongst local car dealers themselves. &#x201c;This campaign took its cue from the consumer insight that within this industry, advice is usually given in order to up-sell the customer to other products,&#x201d; explains Gordon Ray, founding partner and executive creative director at M&C Saatchi Abel CT. &#x201c;The Pretty Penny character served beautifully as a hyperbole of both bad service and lousy advice. Her role is to counterpoint &#x2018;typical&#x2019; tyre dealerships and the kind of bad service most people can relate to with the friendly and professional service offered by BestDrive.&#x201d; Watch the TVC here: http://www.mcsaatchiabel.co.za/work/TheBestDrive
