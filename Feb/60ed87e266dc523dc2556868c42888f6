Innovative yet practical ideas &#x201c;Sage Foundation&#x2019;s Enterprise Fund is designed to help organisations generate further income, create new initiatives or enhance existing activity,&#x201d; says Joanne van der Walt, Sage Foundation manager, Africa at Sage. &#x201c;There are some wonderful charities across Africa who have innovative yet practical ideas about how they can solve some of the socio-economic challenges their communities face each day. We want to help them turn these exceptional ideas into reality.&#x201d; Sage Foundation&#x2019;s Enterprise Fund was originally announced at Sage Summit in Chicago in July 2016, part of a series of new initiatives to mobilise Sage colleagues, partners and customers around a common vision for change. As part of 2017&#x2019;s new Sage Summit Tour, Sage Foundation will be working with Sage&#x2019;s network of business builders, to take action together. The Sage Foundation is powered by the &#x2018;2+2+2&#x2019; model. Through this, Sage Foundation donates 2% of employee time each year (five volunteer days), 2% of free cash flow in grants and two donated software licenses to eligible partners.
