Constantia, Cape TownAs in the Western Cape, Dogon Group Properties Gauteng will focus on high-end sales to clients in the market for exclusive properties in the city&#x2019;s northern suburbs. &#x201c;Opening an office in Gauteng was a natural expansion path for the company,&#x201d; says Denise Dogon, founder and CEO of Dogon Properties Group. &#x201c;Over the next five years we expect strong growth in the luxury property market in Gauteng, with the weaker rand benefiting overseas investors. There is also a huge demand for luxury homes in Gauteng from top executives employed at the major companies which are based here and new developments on the outskirts of Sandton&#x2019;s business district, Hyde Park and Sandhurst will continue to provide world-class value for the finest properties.&#x201d; Dorfman, who has 40 years of experience in Johannesburg&#x2019;s northern suburbs and has twice been a finalist in the Nedbank Property Professional of the Year Awards, is no stranger to record-breaking sales, having recently concluded a landmark R42m land-only deal in the sought-after suburb of Hyde Park. &#x201c;With the reputation and resources of the Dogon Group, coupled with my knowledge and experience in the upmarket suburbs of Gauteng, we will go from strength to strength,&#x201d; says Dorfman. &#x201c;Our goal is to create an unbeatable team of sales people in Gauteng.&#x201d;
