Culinary maestro Pino Lavarra has designed a delicious menu for Cathay Pacific, with an inventive approach, while staying true to the rustic Italian flavours he is known for. Dishes on the menu include: &#x2022; Octopus terrine, lemon, and parsley salad, which will delight passengers with an interesting contrast of temperature and texture between the terrine and the seared octopus layered on top. &#x2022; Beef short ribs, tomato Pizzaiola sauce, and eggplant. Succulent and tender, the short ribs are paired with palate-pleasing herbed tomato sauce and mashed potato. &#x2022; Lobster, almonds, romaine and pink pepper dressing, which features imported tomatoes from Europe, with the dressing created specially by Chef Pino, adding considerable flavour to the salad. In-flight dining with Tosca Cathay Pacific Head of Catering, Aaron Claxton said: &#x201c;We are committed to providing an exceptional &#x2018;Life Well Travelled&#x2019; experience from the very moment our passengers book their flights with us, right through to their destination and beyond. We are, therefore, delighted to be partnering with The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong and their Michelin-starred restaurant Tosca to bring modern interpretations of classic Italian dishes onto our aircrafts.&#x201d; Chef Pino added that: &#x201c;In the sky, there are no limits to your imagination. When working with Cathay Pacific, I was particularly intrigued by the concept of creating intense flavour pairings that can offset the effect that flying at high altitude can have on the sensitivity of our taste buds.&#x201d;
