An alumnus of Red Bull Amaphiko Academy, Bashir launched Trebene, her ethical fashion label designing, printing and hand weaving luxury cashmere scarves in Kashmir, by combining the rich heritage of this luxurious textile with modern and contemporary designs. &#x201c;I was honoured to be selected as one of the 15 designers participating in the London Fashion Week Pop-up Shop by Indie Faces, in Soho,&#x201d; says Bushera. &#x201c;This opportunity will unleash a new phase of growth for Trebene within the European market and we will be able to share the brand at an international level. The last 18 months with Red Bull Amaphiko Academy have been incredible. It has walked this journey with us every step of the way, especially with our international e-commerce site, logistics for the pop-up, etc.&#x201d; The scarves are hand-woven through a delicate ten-step process, which has been perfected over generations. According to Bashir, Kashmir is probably the only place in the world that still weaves cashmere by hand. Most countries use a mechanised shuttle to run power looms. The brand&#x2019;s mission is to preserve this ancient craft that is traditional on the Silk Route since the 14th century. The range is produced by Kashmiri weavers and allows their children to get access to quality education through Trebene&#x2019;s profit contribution. Bashir hopes to deal with buyer frustrations and marketing tricks: too often ordinary fabric is passed off as cashmere in the textile industry. She also wants to bring back the allure of authenticity. &#x201c;Think about Champagne from France and Scotch from Scotland. Trebene makes cashmere from Kashmir, ensuring authenticity of the luxury fabric while adding fresh, contemporary designs,&#x201d; she concludes.
