The 32-page glossy magazine is available free with every copy of the Cape Argus sold today (Tuesday, 28 February 2017). The special publication celebrates the relationship between Cape Town&#x2019;s favourite newspaper and the world&#x2019;s largest individually timed cycle event of its kind. The magazine has pictorials and features showing how both institutions became household names. We interviewed cycling personalities &#x2013; both amateurs and pros. Some have ridden the Cycle Tour for decades, others are fast rising stars in the national and international cycling arena. Read about why this event, and the Cape Argus, is so special to them. Get a glimpse into their lives - their triumphs and tribulations and what keeps them in the saddle. The magazine also showcases the ongoing activism for non-motorised transport and dedicated cycling lanes in Cape Town. Cape Argus editor Aziz Hartley says the magazine is a celebration of two icons in the Mother City. &#x201c;The Cycle Tour is an international event, a highlight on the cycling calendar, but it is truly a Cape Town tradition and just like the Cape Argus it holds a very special place in the hearts and minds of residents. We are excited that we can present our readers with such a special gift,&#x201d; Hartley said. Independent Media&#x2019;s regional executive editor, Western Cape, Gasant Abarder, who edited the magazine, said the magazine is a reflection of the impact of both the Cape Argus and the Cycle Tour. Celebrate this free souvenir edition with the Cape Argus and the Cape Town Cycle Tour today.
