The 30&#x201d; and 90&#x201d; spots feature Gigi Lamayne, 2015 South African Hip Hop Awards Winner Nasty C, Digital Maskandi founder and artist Mashayabhuqe KaMamba and PUMA&#x2019;s own Rolo Rozay lacing up in the IGNITE Limitless Core and IGNITE evoKNIT Fade footwear. PUMA South Africa&#x2019;s Marketing Director, Brett Bellinger, says, &#x201c;It is always so inspiring working on a campaign which is brought to life by local talent. PUMA is a brand for people all over the world, each on their own journey, with PUMA at their side each step of the way.&#x201d; Bellinger continues, &#x201c;We are proud of the work produced, and knew it would be in capable hands with the team from 99c and 0307.&#x201d; Adding to the South African foursome was MC Tumi (Stogie T) as the voice-over artist and music by the incredibly talented Sibot. Andrew Brand, Managing Director of 99c, adds, &#x201c;When people watch the commercial we want them to feel energised, proud and ready to make the world their own. Working with someone as talented as Paul Ward helped us create a really powerful and authentic story. &#x201c;We are proud to play our part in bringing this campaign to life,&#x201d; concludes Brand.
