Event partners include eThekwini Parks and Recreation, and uShaka Marine World. Participants will receive a sponsored educational pack (per school class) as well as a refreshment. Spot prizes will also be awarded. South Africa&#x2019;s most threatened amphibian species There are 125 frog species in South Africa, of which a third are threatened by habitat destruction, increasing levels of pollution in freshwater systems, disease and climate change. The EWT&#x2019;s Threatened Amphibian Programme is working hard to secure populations of some of South Africa&#x2019;s most threatened amphibian species (including the critically endangered Amathole Toad, the endangered Pickersgill&#x2019;s Reed Frog, and the endangered Western Leopard Toad); protect key habitats for threatened amphibians; and raise awareness about frogs and their importance, making Leap Day for Frogs a very important day.
