Visitors enjoying the harvest festival. Having opted out of the morning mountain-biking that whizzed off at 07:30am, we arrived just before noon and walked from the already full parking lot towards the enticing sound of live music and laughter with the air warm, relaxed and simply sizzling with the smell of freshly cooked food. We couldn&#x2019;t wait to get started but we had lots to do before we could sample the filling fare&#x2026; Grape stomping and wine tasting First up, grape stomping for beginners (that&#x2019;s me) and wine tasting in the cobweb-festooned wine cellar. I dare you not to giggle while slowly stepping somewhat precariously into a wide wooden barrel to try your hand &#x2013; or make that &#x2018;foot&#x2019; &#x2013; at grape stomping, with your feet squelching the recently harvested and hand-picked dark red globes. I&#x2019;m proud to say I&#x2019;ve ticked that off my literal &#x2018;bucket&#x2019; list. Stomping up a storm. Things got competitive... Feet hosed clean again, we trotted towards the wine tasting. The estate&#x2019;s staff were all eager to assist and share their favourite stories from working at the farm that dates back to 1685, including the age of those infamous cobwebs as well as the origins of Muratie&#x2019;s wine blends. The Lady Alice MCC was crisp, the blended white and chardonnays were summery and fresh, with the merlot smooth, rich and creamy. All highly educational and enjoyable as the cool cellar is simply steeped in history and well worth a wander around to view the stained glass, art and chandeliers.

Settled, it was time to satiate our senses. As the open live band entertained our ears, our mouths were filled with the delights of the Muratie bread board, positively heaving with a crusty artisanal ciabatta just begging to have hunks sliced or torn off and smeared with a mushy olive tapenade, thick hummus and light basil pesto. This is truly food for sharing and washing down with your favourites from the earlier tasting, as we also had a selection of rich cheeses to choose from including a soft ripe wedge of brie, heavenly wheel of Wineland blue Camembert and sharp blocks of mature cheddar. For the sweet tooth, there were tiny twists of koeksisters, a surprise package of rich, dark brownies, as well as soft, sweet figs that just perfect on their own. Crusty bread. Soft cheese. Warm grapes. Sweet figs. "I had a mouthful of fig and a mouthful of cheese, mmm,&#x201d;, said my mum, while my dad laughed in delight as the full vroue orkes whizzed their way through the likes of Sarie Maree, Suikerbossie and Al le die berge so blou before the Kitchen Jammin Blues Band began twanging out instrumental favourites as conversation reached fever pitch around us. The Kitchen Jammin Blues Band in action. Next came &#x2018;proper food&#x2019; along the likes of gourmet cheesy salsa-topped burgers, fresh steamy spring rolls and spicy samosas, onion-topped salmon-cream cheese sandwiches and wors rolls. Full to the brim, families queued up for tractor rides around the old world-styled estate, the perfect end to a fun-filled afternoon. Keep an eye out for next year&#x2019;s harvest festival to try it yourself, or perhaps Muratie&#x2019;s upcoming winter port festival (perfectly paired with their winter menu) is more your thing. Either way, it&#x2019;s just a short trip down the R44 into the Knorhoek Valley at the foot of the Simonsberg&#x2026; Scroll through the #muratieharvest2017 hashtag for more highlights, follow their Twitter feed for updates.
