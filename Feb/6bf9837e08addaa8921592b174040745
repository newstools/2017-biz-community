Each year, an agency has the privilege of coming up with the Loeries campaign. This year, that honour was bestowed upon DDB, which has been &#x201c;an amazing collaboration with the team at the Loerie Awards,&#x201d; according to the country&#x2019;s third-best creative officer of 2016 &#x2013; that&#x2019;s Wielopolski, according to the latest Loeries Rankings. Wielopolski in non-judging mode.All they needed was a simple executional idea; an idea that was easy to roll out and also cost-effective to maintain. &#x201c;We wanted it to be fun, the colour choice and typeface are funky and fresh, the doodles are inspired by the creative process where everything starts off as a rough scribble,&#x201d; Wielopolski explains. On whether there&#x2019;s a lot of &#x2018;workplace judging&#x2019; in the creative industry in particular, Wielopolski says, &#x201c;While we creatives try our darnedest to be open-minded, we can&#x2019;t help but find ourselves being the most judgmental.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what gave them inspiration for the campaign. But the best is yet to come, as the DDB team is looking forward to also shooting a host of humorous short videos that will be used across various media. He adds that there are a few other surprises in store, but those you&#x2019;re going to have to wait for. Live creatively beyond your 9 to 5 It&#x2019;s not all &#x2018;cloak-and-dagger&#x2019;, though. On the thinking or rationale behind this year&#x2019;s 'We&#x2019;ll judge your work' Loeries campaign, Wielopolski says, &#x201c;The role of the Loerie Awards is to judge the best work from both Africa and the Middle East. The work has to be world-class and entertaining.&#x201d; But we creatives are a different breed. We like to be different, act differently and dress differently. The Loeries aren&#x2019;t interested in that though, they&#x2019;re only interested in one thing: your work. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t judge you, no matter how weird or quirky you are; they&#x2019;ll just judge your work,&#x201d; he explains. So best you make sure your work is great. Creativity isn&#x2019;t limited to the time Wielopolski sits at his desk, either, as he says, &#x201c;Creativity is my life. Yes my day job is a chief creative officer, but after hours when I get home, I still have to be creative, whether it&#x2019;s how to make a delicious, healthy meal, or some new activity to entertain the kids. I always try to do something a little different and special.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s an umbrella philosophy to adopt industry-wide, especially if you&#x2019;re hoping for your work to be judged on its creative excellence in this year&#x2019;s Loerie Awards. Loeries Creative Week 2017 will take place from 14 to 20 August in Durban.
