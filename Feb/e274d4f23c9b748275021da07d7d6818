Their latest partnership involved the sponsorship of a V5-LCE aircraft to ISAP as an additional weapon in their unit to fight poaching activities in Namibia. Our job? We were tasked with the positioning, designing and naming of the plane. We looked at how we can create a symbol that stands, and flies, for anti-poaching. This would be ISAP&#x2019;s eye in the sky &#x2013; a low-flying aircraft that would enable them to spot potential poachers. And so the name, The Protector, was born. It was time to bring The Protector to life. We looked at design options and decided on a camouflage look to ensure The Protector blends into its environment. We worked in ISAP&#x2019;s colours and incorporated Windhoek Lager sponsorship. The handover of the plane took place on 8 February in the presence of several of ISAP&#x2019;s strategic partners, sponsors and supporters.

We&#x2019;re proud to be part of the fight against poaching and giving anti-poaching wings. We truly hope The Protector lives us to its name.
