One of the main changes from III to IV is the &#x2018;apply and explain regime&#x2019;. One of the key objectives of this revised manner of reporting is for stakeholders to be able to tell from reading the integrated report, whether the organisation is indeed achieving a good governance outcome. Knowing how to put your integrated report together in accordance with King IV comes down to knowing your numbers. It&#x2019;s no joke: King IV comes into effect on 1 April this year and if your organisation already incorporates the four governance outcomes (ethical culture, good performance, effective control and legitimacy) into its practices, you&#x2019;ll be in good shape when it comes to drafting your integrated report. Five sector supplements are available to provide extra guidance on drafting a report to municipalities, non-profit organisations, retirement funds, small and medium enterprises and state-owned enterprises. The six capitals, covering financial, manufactured, human, intellectual, social and relationship, and natural, are emphasised in King IV to remind you of all the forms of capital you may use or affect. With seven guiding principles provided, you&#x2019;ll be absolutely clear on what content you need to consider and how to present that content. Then, the eight content elements direct you on precisely what needs to be addressed. Finally, 17 principles (see below) guide organisations on what they should be achieving in the journey towards good governance. From an integrated report point of view, read the content you have put together for the report and then go through each of the 17 principles asking yourself if each one has been demonstrated by your overall content. If you are able to tick off each one, you have your proof points and your job is done.
