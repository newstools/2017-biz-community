To create this #livingdream, Africa&#x2019;s premier d cor, design and lifestyle exhibition portfolio &#x2013; Decorex SA &#x2013; will offer visitors a range of quality items and innovations destined to transform any home into a relaxation haven. Co-sponsored by Plascon and Caesarstone, this leading exhibition allows access to a variety of globally influenced designs and trends which have been localised to suit the South African home. Themed &#x201c;Make your space your living dream&#x201d;, the premier d cor, design and lifestyle expo - which kicks off from 18 to 21 March at the Durban Exhibition Centre - provides not only quality products and ideas to create the ultimate refuge, but also has the nation&#x2019;s top trendsetters on-hand to offer insightful tips and guidance for personalised home and office d cor. &#x201c;Our lives are constantly impacted by the fast-paced, electronic world,&#x201d; said Sian Cullingworth, Portfolio Director: Decorex SA and 100% Design South Africa. &#x201c;This can negatively affect our senses if we don&#x2019;t have a space that allows us to step back and have a moment of quiet introspection. We&#x2019;re seeking refuge in silence, searching for a closeness with nature that, for many people, is an elusive reality instead of something we immerse ourselves in daily. The 2017 theme, &#x2018;Make your space your living dream&#x2019; leans towards this natural ethos within the home, creating a liveable haven that seeps calmness and inspires wholesome, introspective living.&#x201d; This anti-digital lifestyle trend which embraces a serene, sensitive, internalised narrative is reminiscent of the Danish ethos of &#x2018;hygge&#x2019;. Stepping away from the constant electronic interaction of the outside world, people are embracing this notion of hygge which represents the warmth and wellbeing that can be found within our own spaces, specifically aimed at comfort and happiness. By escaping the external noise, people are experiencing a better life and greater wellbeing in a calmer space. Cullingworth continued, saying that the creation of this relaxed environment can be found throughout the Decorex SA exhibitions which seek to soothe the senses through various home-enhancing features and culinary experiences. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all about textile furnishing that exudes an aura of relaxation and calm,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;The overload of sleek, smooth finishes that dominate the electronics&#x2019; industry means our bodies are desperately craving the feel of a textured environment. By including wood in our d cor, using soft, natural, earthy tones in our wall finishes and furniture as well as incorporating plants or plant &#x2018;green&#x2019; prints, we feel closer to nature. There is also a strong connection between wellness and the colour green.&#x201d; Cullingworth said that visitors to the show will be inspired through the exhibition&#x2019;s innovations and trends. &#x201c;People will be able to &#x2018;make their space their living dream&#x2019; at the Decorex SA exhibitions through our showcase of the latest trends in furniture, d cor and finishes - which are setting new standards for interiors &#x2013; as well as the 2017 colour currents displayed throughout the restaurants and installations at the show.&#x201d; Make sure you don&#x2019;t miss out on the premier d cor and design expo which promises to be an inspiring day out Decorex SA details: Decorex Durban: 18 &#x2013; 21 March 2017 Time: 18-20 March: 10am &#x2013; 8pm | 21 March: 10am &#x2013; 6pm Ticket prices: Adults: R85, Pensioners: R 75, Children under 12: R20 Venue: Durban Exhibition Centre Decorex Cape Town: 27 &#x2013; 30 April 2017 Time: 10am &#x2013; 6pm daily Ticket prices: Adults: R95, Pensioners: R85, Children under 12: R20 Venue: Cape Town International Conference Centre Decorex Johannesburg: 9 &#x2013; 13 August 2017 Time: 10am &#x2013; 6pm daily Ticket prices: Adults: R120, Pensioners: R100, Children under 12: R20 Venue: Gallagher Convention Centre For more information, email az.oc.deerebeht&#64;ofnixeroced Visit: www.decorex.co.za Facebook: Decorex SA Twitter: @decorexSA Instagram: decorex_sa LinkedIn: Decorex SA Pinterest: Decorex SA Blog: www.thebereed.co.za/decorexblog/ About Reed Exhibitions Reed Exhibitions is the world&#x2019;s leading event&#x2019;s organiser, with over 500 events in 30 countries.
