Mobile web weather provider, AccuWeather aims to understand the unique needs and expectations of mobile users and can provide strategic mobile-first insights and customised campaign solutions to advertisers. It has applied this expertise to design an all-new mobile advertising suite that provides greater campaign viewability, engagement and contextual relevancy to clients, integrating brands into the mobile weather experience. This innovative product suite was developed within its most accessed content - local weather information and updates with Superior Accuracy located on its current conditions mobile page. With the addition of weather-triggered criteria and a new integrated advertising display, the experience becomes more relevant and targeted for users, specific to their dynamically changing location. Michelin Wiper Blades began using the new mobile integration suite to further elevate its brand exposure and drive greater awareness of its high-quality wiper blades across the US. With direction from Michelin&#x2019;s agency of record, Harmelin Media, AccuWeather designed a campaign package that used precipitation, including rain and snow, to convey the client&#x2019;s message. Beyond targeting ads based on local weather conditions, AccuWeather&#x2019;s design team used precipitation as the backdrop of the creative and included Michelin&#x2019;s popular Michelin Man to extend the power of the brand. AccuWeather has plans to expand its advertising solutions portfolio, launching additional mobile, native and viewable product suites in 2017. It has developed exclusive technologies to pinpoint geographically all forms of content to individual users and to their dynamically changing location. These technologies are protected by a worldwide patent portfolio allowing for a true global reach in connecting people with information. As a result, only it can offer these unique capabilities to its partners and clients. For more information, click here.
