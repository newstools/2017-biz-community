Says Miguel Chan, &#x201c;The South African wines we select at auctions showcase the exceptional care and effort that winemakers have put in to produce great wines, which in turn echoes our approach to our world-class food and beverage offering throughout the group. Our auction wines will continue to add something special to every occasion &#x2013; and we look forward to sharing them with our guests.&#x201d; Tsogo Sun took top honours the third consecutive year for wines purchased by a single bidder at the 2016 auctions.
