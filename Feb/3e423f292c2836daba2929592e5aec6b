This is the safest and most convenient way to get the job done, says Andre Hugo, head of Gumtree Connect. &#x201c;All our service providers are vetted before appearing on the app. Homeowners will also be able to provide a rating (out of five stars) once the work is completed.&#x201d; The app is extremely simple to use. &#x201c;The homeowner loads a description and photos of the work that needs to be done on the app, e.g. a faulty geyser. The five service providers with the highest rating, closest to your address, will appear on the screen and provide quotations that can be accepted or rejected immediately. Once you&#x2019;ve accepted a quote, you can schedule an appointment directly. Funds are securely held and only released to the provider once the work has been completed.&#x201d; Hugo says that while there are similar apps on the market, none of them have the advantage of Gumtree&#x2019;s significant user base. &#x201c;Close to six million South Africans use Gumtree every single month, and thousands of service providers find their leads on our site &#x2013; Gumtree Connect just makes it so much easier for them to get in touch."
