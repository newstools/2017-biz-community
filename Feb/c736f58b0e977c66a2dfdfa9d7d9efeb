&#x201c;At Automotive Brands SA and Autobarn SA, we are complete petrol heads and live for all motorsport. The SuperHatch series has been excellent for our brand so it was a no-brainer to retain the SuperHatch Series for 2017,&#x201d; says managing director, Terry Brand. The company will also retain 42-year-old Centurion-based team driver and SuperHatch champion, Brett Garland (Autobarn SA Honda). Garland has a colourful career in motorsport and has competed in the series for the last six years.
