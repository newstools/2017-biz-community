Ayabonga Cawe, an economist and commentator on socio-economic developments in South Africa joins the station as the new host of Power Hour, which will now air from 5-6pm Monday to Thursday.

Weekend programming As part of its line-up refreshment, the station is introducing four-hour time slots for its weekend programming. Power listeners will now wake up to AK Tshabalala who takes on the 6-10am slot on Saturdays and Sundays. The weekend line-up also comes with new and young talent, mostly from community radio stations, including AB Da Costa on Fridays and Saturdays from 11pm-2am and Becky Motumo and Mputla Mpya from 2-6am on Saturday and Sunday mornings respectively. Head of programing, Ferdinand Mabalane says, &#x201c;The changes are a reflection of the evolving needs of the station&#x2019;s growing audience. We welcome the new voices to the station and thank all talent who have contributed to our growth. We take pride having provided a platform to talent that had no previous talk radio experience prior to joining Power 98.7 and who have now grown into household talk radio names. These include Iman Rappetti, Aphelele Somi, Andile Khumalo, JJ Tabane, Masechaba Ndlovu and Thabo Mdluli, to mention a few.
