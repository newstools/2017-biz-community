The hospitality and tourism industry in its entirety is a driving force in our economy and to simply play a small role in this, is significant to the bigger picture.&#x201d; Pepler continues, &#x201c;We strive to uplift that local family business that has put blood, sweat and tears into their establishment, to show people the utmost dedication that goes into running a guest house or B&B and then on the other hand we want to show recognition to the four and five-star hotels that are doing everything right in terms of service offering and deserve an applause.&#x201d; Entries are open to all accommodation establishments in South Africa and there are nine categories available to enter.
