Making an impact in development work is not always a question of resources but rather an issue of demarche and strategy. They identified structural transformation for economic and social development; transport; and trade facilitation for greater intra-Africa trade, amongst the top items for joint work in the sub-region with great potential to make a difference on the field. After reviewing how much progress has been made in the work of the Steering Committee for the Harmonisation of Regional Economic Communities in Central Africa (COPIL/CER-AC, in French), they said it was time to go back to the drawing board and prompt States to move forward with the 12 urgent domains that had been earlier identified as areas which, both CEMAC and ECCAS could work on without duplication of efforts. These include: the free movement of persons and goods, trade issues, security issues, transport interconnectedness, energy, food security, ICTs, integration financing mechanisms, budgetary and monetary policies, environmental issues, health and a CEMAC-ECCAS consultation framework. &#x201c;Making an impact in development work is not always a question of resources but rather an issue of demarche and strategy,&#x201d; said Kane. He underscored that beyond the strategic dimensions and outlook his institution and ECA could build on regional integration, the Bank considers it vital to also work in sectors that promote inclusive growth. ECA&#x2019;s Pedro added that in line with the vision of the new UN Secretary General, beyond economic and social transformation issues and questions of access to market and global value chains, it was important to also work into the dynamic relationships between development, peace and security (against a backdrop of conflict) and human rights to usher in a novel transformative policy mix. &#x201c;It is now crucial to elevate the dialogue on these issues with likeminded organisations so that we and the member States we serve can all benefit from that openness.&#x201d;
