While the new Google calendar is pretty amazing, there&#x2019;s something special about a planner you can hold and get inspiration from; about taking some time in your morning to jot down your thoughts, things you&#x2019;d like to achieve or just get your head around all you have to do in the day. this is real life // us feeling totally silly having our photo taken for the website &#xfffd;&#xfffd; anyhoo - here we are! xx Anel + Jen &#xfffd;&#xfffd; A post shared by Blush Paper Company (@blushpapercompany) on Nov 27, 2016 at 2:07am PST Anel van der Merwe and Jennifer Attwood-Smith from Blush Paper Company created exactly that. A planner that&#x2019;s not only visually appealing, but also encouraging with tips for each month; one that not only comprises a calendar, but shopping lists, a vacation planner, a finance planner and a notes tab. Even a daily water intake counter for goodness sake! Here, they share their inspiration for such a planner and what it meant to design such a beautiful collection. What led you to start Blush Paper Company? We were looking for a beautiful and highly functional planner and we couldn&#x2019;t find one on the market! No planner on the market satisfied our need for detailed planning. And no planner on the market really inspired us to want to live our best lives. So we decided to go for it and create our own! What went into creating Your Weekly Edit? From beginning to end. It took us around three months of super late nights and hard work to create and finish &#x2018;Your Weekly Edit&#x2019; (YWE). It started right at the bottom from brainstorming our vision and designs to creating the layouts we wanted for the different calendar views, and researching what our target market wanted in a planner. We really put a great amount of effort into making this a useful planner, because how many times have you bought a beautiful planner and never used it past the second week of February? That&#x2019;s happened too often with us and we really wanted to avoid that with YWE. We created all the different sections in the planner to nudge our customers to scribble their goals down or their happy moments each week. Not only did it have to be top quality and visually stunning, YWE had to be useful and practical and thus there is a lot of detail inside the planner for the customer to live and experience and use throughout the entire year. Comment on the design. The design of YWE was extremely important to us. We wanted this planner to spark joy in every single customer. It&#x2019;s a book that you carry with you and use every single day, so it needs to be beautiful and durable. We tried to create enough cover designs to cater for a wide range of people while ultimately sticking to our aesthetic and to ensure coherence across the covers. We wanted the covers to be striking yet minimalistic. Stunning but not loud. We want to evoke a sense of confidence in our customers when they carry their YWE around and we hope we have achieved that this year. Do you plan to change the design every year? For sure. Each year will have new, fresh designs that we love and that we know our customers will love while staying up to date with design trends. Why blush (and gold)? They are both striking colours that complement each other so well. Plus, we&#x2019;re both obsessed with the combination. What do you love most about the planner? We love that it&#x2019;s functional and beautiful. That was our goal from the very beginning and we&#x2019;re so happy to say we&#x2019;ve achieved this. A post shared by Blush Paper Company (@blushpapercompany) on Nov 22, 2016 at 8:00am PST How do you find working together as friends and in two different cities? And who does what? We&#x2019;re so lucky in that we support and &#x2018;get&#x2019; each other. We have similar values, similar ways of going about things, and we respect each other which is so important in a friend/business partner relationship. Living in two different cities is a bit hard &#x2013; we won&#x2019;t lie. But it&#x2019;s a challenge we&#x2019;re tackling head on and working to create rhythm and routine within our business. We don&#x2019;t have set tasks or titles &#x2013; we usually chat early in the morning and make a list of what we have to do, and we each decide then who does what. Is this a side project or a full-time job? What started out as a small project has exploded into a full-time venture and we are so blessed that it has! We're excited for what is to come this year! Comment on your use of social media to market the product. We solely use Instagram and Facebook to advertise. They are such amazing channels and have such a huge reach. We&#x2019;ve never paid for an advertisement either &#x2013; we try and keep things as organic as possible and so far it&#x2019;s been working well! We feel that a product will speak for itself and so we will keep creating top quality products that our customers need. Any other products in planning, and/or are you already working on next year&#x2019;s planners? We're in the process of launching new notebooks in different shapes and sizes to accompany YWE, so keep a lookout for those soon! We'll definitely be branching out into more desk accessories &#x2013; anything and everything to keep your life (and desk) simplified, organised, inspired, and looking sharp. We'll start working on YWE2018 in March, and we aim to start selling it in September this year. Comment on the response you&#x2019;ve had to your planners. Our feedback has been amazing so far. Our customers love their planners and appreciate its detail, high quality and beauty. We are so grateful! We&#x2019;ve had some great constructive criticism as people have started using their planners and we definitely encourage this &#x2013; we are creating products to enhance our customers&#x2019; lives, so we need their honest feedback and will take it to heart. We're excited to start working and improving on YWE for 2018. Best compliment you&#x2019;ve had on your planners? It&#x2019;s hard to pick the best one. We value all of our customers&#x2019; feedback and compliments! But it definitely makes us smile when our customers send us an email just as they've received their planner gushing about their excitement for the year. And what are you most excited about? Growing our business! We can&#x2019;t wait to create more products and to ultimately inspire and help our customers live beautiful, well organised lives. The collection consisted of Blush + Emerald Watercolour; Grey Watercolour; Blush + Marble Geometric; Gold Pineapple; and Tropical Palm and sold for R450 each. View the range here.
