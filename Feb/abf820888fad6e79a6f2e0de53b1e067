 Cathy Yeulet via 123RF&#x201c;There&#x2019;s never been a better time for women to lead. We are living in extraordinary times, both globally and at home. There is a growing sense of empowerment, of ordinary people taking their destiny into their own hands and standing up for themselves. For women, this is an ideal time to step up, speak up and take our place as leaders,&#x201d; says Debby Edelstein, women&#x2019;s leadership consultant and co-founder of QualityLife Company. Speakers The conference has become well known for boasting accomplished women leaders on its panels within a warm, informal environment. The lineup of keynote speakers is diverse. Some of the confirmed speakers include special envoy on gender at the African Development Bank, Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi; MD of Africommunications Group, Mimi Kalinda; CEO of Ocean Basket, Grace Harding; and founding dean and professor in the area of strategy and leadership at the Gordon Institute of Business Science, Nick Binedell. It also serves as a platform for young African women to access mentorship from more experienced women leaders. The programme includes guidance on fast-tracking one&#x2019;s career from &#x201c;good manager&#x201d; to &#x201c;great leader&#x201d;.
