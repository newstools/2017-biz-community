Because the technology eliminates the need for circuit boards, charge controllers, or chipsets &#x2013; components that are notorious for breakage - the hand-held SunStream&#x2122; solar panels are extremely durable, and have been developed to be waterproof. This patented technology offers a breakthrough solution for mobile users anywhere, seeking convenient and reliable mobile electricity.
