Top PerformerCarla da Silva, Air Mauritius regional manager, Southern Africa and Latin America, presided over the formal proceedings of the awards, with much pride over the sterling achievements of the industry, despite yet another challenging year navigated through turbulent airspace. &#x201c;In South Africa, we had local elections in 2016, currency volatility and devaluation - along with inflation and cost of living increases - which all impacted on travel decisions and patterns. Flat travel spend remains the forecast, coupled with an increased focus on return on investment (ROI) for the corporate sector. We have seen the following trends: &#x2022; A reduction in travel in many corporations across South Africa, along with the rest of Africa &#x2022; Companies reducing their travel classes ~ economy for all as opposed to business class &#x2022; Businesses sending fewer staff on conferences and requiring that the one or two that are sent (as opposed to the usual four or five), to return and report back to their teams regarding what was learned during conference &#x201c;From a leisure perspective, the consumer is constantly shopping around for better deals and we have witnessed late booking patterns for holidays that were previously planned way in advance.&#x201d; Da Silva added: &#x201c;From an Air Mauritius South Africa perspective, and despite all of the aforementioned challenges, Air Mauritius managed to sustain and grow the local business, with sincere and heartfelt thanks to our valued partners and loyal, long-standing friends. We aim to achieve budget by 31 March 2017, and to continue to increase our revenue, capacity, and frequencies in this market.&#x201d; Air Mauritius posted EUR28.1m for the first nine months of the current financial year. Seats offered increased by 7.5 percent to reach 586,002 and the load factor increased from 80 percent to 81 percent.

In da Silva&#x2019;s closing message to her travel trade colleagues and key industry stakeholders, she shared the following inspirational message: &#x201c;I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge; dreams are more powerful than facts and that hope always triumphs over experience. The obstacles we faced in 2016, and indeed since our inception 50 years ago, will become the gateways and successful flight paths, that will lead to new beginnings in 2017.&#x201d; In terms of the next year&#x2019;s annual awards; it would be difficult to raise the elevated benchmark set for 2016.
