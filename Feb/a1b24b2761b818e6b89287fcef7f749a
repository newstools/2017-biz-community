This skin care innovation was revealed at the opening of The Pond&#x2019;s Institute pop-up experience at Sandton City, which runs from 22 February - 12 March 2017. Consumers can visit it and learn more about the science behind Pond&#x2019;s products, experience the Environmental Skin Damage Capsule, get a personalised skin analysis and receive a skin care regime tailored to their specific needs. Global dermatologists who recently attended New Skin Order: The Changing Face of Acne &#x2013; an international symposium hosted by The Pond&#x2019;s Institute &#x2013; revealed that pimple sufferers are facing a slew of modern-day skin stressors such as urbanisation, changing diets, pollution and increased societal pressure, which affects their experience of pimples. &#x201c;There is an urgent need today to equip patients with credible, clinically-proven pimple solutions and information as they increasingly seek to self-manage the effects of pimples in modern life,&#x201d; said local dermatologist Dr Pholile Mpofu, who attended the symposium. &#x201c;For years, people have been unsuccessful in their search for an effective pimple solution. Despite the multitude of products available, pimples still afflict an estimated 1 in 10 people, making them the eighth most prevalent skin problem worldwide,&#x201d; said Unilever personal care public relations manager, Sphelele Mjadu. The range is used in the morning and evening, as part of a daily regime and is available for purchase at all food, pharmacy and mass market retailers across South Africa.
