Its bright, contemporary interiors, enlarged food court, vibrant &#x2018;First for Namibia&#x2019; family entertainment facility are part of the new look and feel. The mall, established in 1990, is Windhoek&#x2019;s original shopping centre and it welcomes over nine million shoppers every year. The phased upgrade offers everything under one roof, from entertainment and dining to leisure and shopping. Public areas and walkways will be upgraded in keeping with the new, contemporary look, while a timber-slatted ceiling suspended with liquid-crystal light hoops will be installed. Carel Fourie, newly appointed CEO of Oryx Properties, owner of the centre, describes it as, &#x201c;More than a shopping experience: It offers everything from convenient shopping to a fun, family dining experience.&#x201d; The food court will be redesigned over two levels, making space for new restaurants. An outside eating area will offer close proximity to the family entertainment centre &#x201c;We are excited to be introducing a trampoline park, glow-in-the-dark putt-putt, bowling alley, a climbing wall and more,&#x201d; says centre manager Thea Thornley. The mall&#x2019;s four entrances and ample parking, including dedicated parking for the disabled and elderly, as well as moms and tots make access a breeze. The mall is named after the trees that surround it. Ringwoods (Maerua schinzii) are a protected species in Namibia. &#x201c;The tree is symbolic of sustainability and vitality and this resonates with our ethos,&#x201d; says Fourie. The mall&#x2019;s commitment to sustainability is evident in its N$17 million 1MWp rooftop solar-power plant, which generates about 20% of the centre&#x2019;s electricity. The 1407 MWh generated by the plant during the 2016 financial year reduced the mall&#x2019;s CO2 emissions by 1128 tons.
