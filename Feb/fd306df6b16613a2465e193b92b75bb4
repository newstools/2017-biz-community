The launch, which took place at Edgars Sandton City and Edgars Mall of Africa on Saturday, 18 February, allowed the public to Shazam the Azzaro &#x2018;Wanted&#x2019; TV commercial, to explore exclusive content and enter for a chance to win the fragrance. All shoppers had to do was: 1. Make sure their Bluetooth was switched on 2. Open the Shazam application on their smartphone 3. Spray the Azzaro &#x2018;Wanted&#x2019; fragrance into the air 4. Tap the Shazam button 5. Their phone automatically identified the fragrance and offered them a unique page of Azzaro &#x2018;Wanted&#x2019; content, as well as an opportunity to win prizes &#x201c;Watching the Shazam application identify a track as seamlessly as it does still feels like magic, even after all these years,&#x201d; said Hannes Prinsloo, country representative for Shazam. &#x201c;Wanting to Shazam something other than music, for instance a taste or a smell, is something that most people around the world have thought at some time or another, but obviously that technology hasn&#x2019;t been developed yet - although this campaign gives us a glimpse. It is not often South African companies have the opportunity to innovate a world-first experience, especially when it comes to consumer technology. We were in a fortuitous position with the Azzaro &#x2018;Wanted&#x2019; launch, as we were working alongside a forward-thinking client who shared our innovative ideals.&#x201d; Had so much fun at the #wantedazzaro launch today.

He takes chances, is rebellious and lives life as he pleases. It is with this spirit that we have challenged Shazam to take their sensory experiment to an exciting new encounter.&#x201d; Consumers that weren't able to make it to the physical launch can Shazam the new Azzaro &#x2018;Wanted&#x2019; TV commercial for exclusive content or catch further Azzaro &#x2018;Wanted&#x2019; video snippets across their social media channels.
