...that many popular social media platforms are designed to make you feel as if you&#x2019;re opening an assorted pack of chocolates and choosing your personal favourite - and that any brand can use this insight fruitfully? This more advanced digital age has brought about big changes in the way we seek information and importantly &#x2013; how we filter through it... We used to watch the news on the TV more religiously &#x2013; now we just pick and choose which accounts to follow and un-follow on Twitter and YouTube. We used to get entertained by channel surfing and Google searching, and I&#x2019;m definitely not saying we don&#x2019;t do those things anymore, but now &#x2013; younger generations are more likely to log in to their personalised Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram and Youtube accounts where content is sorted according to interests and subscriptions. What&#x2019;s your point? The point is that people are increasingly looking for instant, live, bite-sized and personalised gratification. Look at Snapchat &#x2013; messaging has become so bite-sized that all you actually get is a bite &#x2013; and then it&#x2019;s gone! Even though this behavioural &#x2018;shift&#x2019; applies mainly to Gen Y and the newer Z, it has significantly impacted how all tech-savvy people are finding information. And the point is to know how to adapt lucratively... Insight 1 &#x2013; Our information filters have evolved parallel to the tools we use to inform ourselves We no longer embrace branding that isn&#x2019;t interesting and clever, just because the product/service does the job &#x2013; why? Firstly: it&#x2019;s unlikely that we&#x2019;ve even heard of those brands. Secondly: with so many options, why would we settle for anything less? So let&#x2019;s talk about online shopping for the sake of being relatable: we really are spoiled for choice these days, and with that, comes a few considerations: We Use Google to find websites (Google is your homepage, right?). We have a natural tendency to buy from the website that looks the most professional (functional, eye-catching, interesting and responsive to mobiles and tablets). It&#x2019;s important to note that great bite-size content is visually appealing. (This is the Instagram generation - they know what great imagery looks like and brands need to understand how important that is for success.) We also choose a website based on how enticing it is to flow from page to page (user experience) and how safe we feel about filling up that shopping cart and proceeding to checkout. It&#x2019;s now so much easier to research different product offerings and get the best deals, so consider that your prospects are most likely looking at your competitors&#x2019; sites too. Acid test: Google search your product/service description from a realistic consumer-perspective - how does your brand stack up now? If your brand is lower than the top four below the ads &#x2013; your wisest investment would probably be to initiate a professional, ongoing SEO campaign. </li></li></li>To adapt to these changes in our info filters, Powerhouse Advertising recommends firstly that we review and fortify your brand's current business and marketing strategies in relation to the target audience and competitors &#x2013; strategy meetings give us valuable insights and lead both parties to some priceless &#x201c;Ah-ha!&#x201d; moments. Next, we&#x2019;d review your online presence so that we can tell you how much it will take to get your brand on the fastest and most efficient route to success. Alternatively, we&#x2019;ll be able to work with your budget and tell you how best to spend it. Insight 2: &#x201c;The ol&#x2019; info shotgun is rusty and barrel-bent&#x201d; The &#x201c;shotgun approach&#x201d; to advertising is best explained with an example: we&#x2019;ve had clients who previously chose to allocate their limited advertising spend towards print advertising done inconsistently and based on a very limited scope of research. Years of experience has taught us that in comparison to more modern strategies and techniques, attempting to get leads this way really is a shot in the dark - really bad value for money... What would you say if I told you to lay that rusty ol&#x2019; shotgun to rest for good? And that there&#x2019;s barely any compromise to calling in a few targeted info-airstrikes... Now is the time for taking aim and keeping it true with your ever-moving target audience &#x2013; launch targeted content that catches their eyes and their curiousity, content which is highly relevant to their lifestyle and easy to digest. Do this and you&#x2019;ll get them thinking, keep doing it as part of an integrated campaign and you&#x2019;ll get them hooked and sharing. &#x201c;In the past, the clear-cut laws of supply and demand essentially guided marketing activity for most brands. However, in today&#x2019;s complex marketplace, there is an additional layer to take into consideration and that is the role of customer and brand experience. In this context, successful brands of the future will be those that understand the importance of designing communications and creating experiences that have the ability to single out an individual within the crowd.&#x201d; - Nonku Mabena (http://themediaonline.co.za/2016/05/niche-is-the-new-mass/) Niche is the new mass right? That being said - social media marketing should be one of the tools that springs to mind: when done right, this involves a well-researched strategic undercurrent for all the messaging going out and importantly &#x2013; for the messages to be aligned and targeted to cleverly defined groups. If the fun-oriented platforms like Facebook and Instagram don&#x2019;t suit your brand, perhaps a more corporate and professional platform like LinkedIn will... LinkedIn allows for targeting based on industry, job titles, job seniority and many more - Powerhouse prides itself with being able to develop integrated strategies that get engagements, leads and enhance brand image. The beauty of social media advertising lies also in its measurability &#x2013; from website click-through rates and leads generated to engagements and page follows attributed to each ad/promoted post. Insight 3: Agility is key Peoples&#x2019; habits are evolving so rapidly, meaning that effective brand strategy needs to be more agile than ever before. Thus, brands should constantly question and refresh their marketing outlooks and efforts - to be as adaptable, fresh and relevant as possible. In the past, the brands that got noticed were the ones that had &#x2018;the biggest neon signs&#x2019; - so to speak. Now, the brands rolling out the most interesting, concise and relatable content whilst creating trending hashtags are the ones thriving. It&#x2019;s a beautiful thing when you think about the fact that people find value in supporting brands they feel a part of, brands that have conversations with them rather than ones that tell them what to do &#x2013; isn&#x2019;t that so much more interesting for everyone? Powerhouse Advertising refers to this as "Moving from tell to sell" and it&#x2019;s a concept that is always with us when strategising - &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell them what to do, invite them to dance with you.&#x201d; If you want to dance with Generation Z for example, you&#x2019;re going to have to develop some &#x2018;snackable&#x2019; content &#x2013; these young bloods want to know at least a little bit about everything going on right now. The implication for marketers is that lengthy content is unlikely to resonate with Gen Z and therefore - the use of infographics, videos, precise and catchy copy is far more likely to be appreciated and shared. This is a trend that Powerhouse predicts will become the norm for generations to come. We&#x2019;re definitely not saying that humans will stop reading articles and lengthier website copy &#x2013; because there will always be a place for it &#x2013; what we&#x2019;re saying is that it&#x2019;s now more important than ever to use copy that is as concise and catchy as possible. &#x201c;But everyone&#x2019;s a copywriter, right?&#x201d; Yes &#x2013; even Zuma&#x2019;s speech writers.
