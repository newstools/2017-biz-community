 Peter Titmuss via 123RF - Sauvignon blanc grapes arriving at Goudini Cellar in Rawsonville, Western Cape South Africa&#x201c;In a depressed economy where wine retail price increases are below inflation, wine producers and cellars will find it difficult to absorb these increases,&#x201d; said Rico Basson, managing director of VinPro, the representative organisation for close to 3,500 South African wine producers and cellars. Only a third of grape producers are currently operating at financially sustainable levels and return on investment has dropped below 2%. The industry comprises 97,000 ha under wine grapes and employs close to 300,000 people in total. &#x201c;Investment, policy certainty and direct support with regard to agriculture-related aspects such as housing, water, land, and market access will be critical to take the industry forward,&#x201d; said Basson. The industry remains concerned about the extent of illicit trade and the socio-economic impact of alcohol abuse and calls on the government for a responsible policy framework with joint, direct interventions. &#x201c;The South African wine and brandy industry is busy with the implementation of a new strategic framework, the Wine Industry Strategic Exercise (Wise). Close collaboration with and support from government will be key in reaching the set targets,&#x201d; said Basson.
