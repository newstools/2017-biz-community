The event will see the City of Cape Town&#x2019;s public spaces morph into new dimensions as they fill with visual and performance art, dance, music, video and more from an extraordinary group of local and international artists. This year Khanyisile Mbongwa and Leila Anderson lead the curatorial team, each bringing their own unique perspectives to assembling this diverse programme. In no particular order, ITC artworks will be announced in batches over the course of the next month. Check the website, Facebook page and Twitter page for updates.
