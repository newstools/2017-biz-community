John J. Coetzee, CEO at Green WorxJohn J. Coetzee, CEO at Green Worx, is proud of this achievement. &#x201c;This certification is the culmination of many years of hard work. We don&#x2019;t believe in &#x2018;greenwashing&#x2019; &#x2013; which not all South African manufacturers can claim. Our products, and all of the ingredients used to create them, have a great impact on dirt, and no impact on the environment. That&#x2019;s our commitment to creating a world that is cleaner, greener and smarter.&#x201d; The GreenTag Programme is intended to fill a current void, nationally and internationally, for a consistent green product rating scheme that is scientifically derived, life cycle assessment-based, and includes appropriate assessment of whole of life and holistic sustainability. &#x201c;This is essential to real credibility in the industry, avoiding fly-by-night organisations that play on the need to retain precious resources in order to make a quick profit,&#x201d; says Coetzee. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re proud to display the GreenTag logo on our labels, and are committed to continue manufacturing products that are worthy of the certification,&#x201d; he concludes.
