The Arangies&#x2019; Ferrari led Stradale teammates Simon Murray and Gavin Cronje's Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 to victory in the 6-hour, but Murray also took the Lambo to GT3 victory in the GT Challenge opener. Jonathan Schenkman won the Challenge Class with his similar Stradale Gallardo and Harry Arangies won GT4 with the team's Ford Mustang. Said Charl Arangies: "On Friday the Lamborghini hardly turned a wheel as we had wiring harness problems that we fixed in the early hours Saturday and then the Ferrari suffered a broken power steering pump. I actually qualified without power steering and still managed a third on the grid, before the guys scrambled to replace the pump.&#x201d; The Arangies however, defied the odds and brought the Ferrari to a 6-hour victory. "We knew that we never had the pace of the big cars, but then we had good old fashioned Ferrari reliability and except for a gear shifting issue, we just kept the car on track kept to our strategy. Both cars ran like clockwork on Pirelli slicks and Motul lubricants - without them, nothing would be possible,&#x201d; he said. Stradale now focuses on the next rounds of the SA Endurance Championship and GT Challenge at Killarney in Cape Town in April.
