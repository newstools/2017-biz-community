The SAFTA team at the National Film and Video Foundation (NFVF) with assistance from SAFTA committee members (CCISFA, SASFED, eTV, Mnet, SABC and Starsat) have put in a tremendous effort to ensure that the awards uphold a standard of excellence and remain a world class production. The awards will take place on 16-18 March 2017 in Sun City. The audience can watch the live show on 18 March on SABC 2 at 8pm. With the awards being in their 11th year of celebrating growth and talent, the 11th annual SAFTAs have been themed 'SA&#x2019;s got it &#x2013; let&#x2019;s celebrate it' which is a well-suited vision of looking towards setting higher goals for the South African film and television industry. Zama Mkosi, CEO of the NFVF, said, "We are extremely proud and honoured to have finally reached this stage of the SAFTAs 11, we as the NFVF would like to congratulate all the nominees and hope to encourage the industry to continue striving while setting its own rules around what success looks like for the business of film. Each year comes with its own challenges and growth opportunities that we highly prioritise. The NFVF will continue to strive for transparency and solutions in order to make sure that the SAFTAs showcase not only the glamorous side of the industry, but the underlying wealth of talent, education, skill and most importantly the passion that the South African industry truly has." The NFVF would like to acknowledge and thank all the 181 SAFTAs 11 judges for their invaluable contribution and dedication to the adjudication and voting process that started in December 2016. Their work under the directorship and guidance from the three overall judging chairs; Jerry Mofokeng, Firdoze Bulbulia and Dr John Kani has finally resulted in a crucial and exciting part of the SAFTAs 11 journey concluding the SAFTAs 11 nominees. All the auditing for the SAFTAs 11 judging process has been officially procured by PWC South Africa. Key to the success of SAFTAs 11 are the private sector partners that have come on board such as Sun International, Mc Caf and Ster Kinekor.
