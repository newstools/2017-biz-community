According to Gumtree spokesperson Claire Cobbledick, the company was made aware of the issue by both the SPCA and Ban Animal Trading, and decided to take action. &#x201c;While there are many reputable farmers who trade in donkey hides and live animals, we decided that extreme measures would be necessary to prevent further unsavoury practises.&#x201d; Gumtree immediately banned the sale of donkey hides after the expos aired on 29 January, and then extended the ban further. Stolen, transported and brutally slaughtered According to a letter distributed by Ban Animal Trading, animal welfare organisations in South Africa are regularly receiving reports of donkeys slaughtered in rural areas for their skins. The National Council of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals states that &#x201c;donkeys are being rounded up, stolen, then transported and brutally slaughtered for their skins&#x201d; (this can include bludgeoning them in the head and even skinning them alive). Even before the slaughtering, these donkeys are subjected to terrible living conditions (some being starved) as well as horrific transportation situations (including no access to food or even water). Gumtree has significantly restricted the sale of animals on their platform over the last 12 months, including banning the sale of primates, sugar gliders, African Greys, teacup piglets, hedgehogs and dogs deemed vulnerable for use in dog fighting (&#x201c;power breeds&#x201d;).
