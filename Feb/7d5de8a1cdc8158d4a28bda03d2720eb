Rabbi David MasinterThe South African developed ARK app is a simple yet powerful tool for the world&#x2019;s influential generation of millennials to change the world, where kindness begets kindness. To teach the influential generation of millennials about kindness, whether it is buying an extra burger to give to someone who is hungry, volunteering at the local SPCA, or helping Mom out by offering to run some errands, the app encourages a sense of gratification for the achievement of having reached a goal. The idea behind the app was sparked because millennials are spending hours and hours a day on social media and yet at the same time, there is still so much bullying and negativity around the world, so what better way to engage with them and teach them the importance of kindness. &#x201c;Although driven by deep spiritual values this is no holier-than-thou initiative,&#x201d; says Rabbi David Masinter. &#x201c;It is fun, intriguing, rewarding - bursting with attitude and cool intent, with loads of incredible interactivity.&#x201d; One of the most tangible ways that Change our World for Good works to create a cycle of kindness is by distributing ARK charity boxes, which are moneyboxes that people fill with spare change and then pass onto others who need the coins more than they do. &#x201c;ARK will not take the full boxes back to fund its own charitable deeds and the acts of random kindness come directly from the people who have filled them,&#x201d; continues Masinter. &#x201c;Change our World for Good is hoping to distribute one million boxes in 2017.&#x201d; Acts of Random Kindness Week The ARK App is available now in Apple and Android app stores. ARK has named this week &#x2018;Acts of Random Kindness Week&#x2019; and numerous initiatives, fronted by the likes of comedian John Vlismas, will spread the message. Change the World for Good also partners with other companies&#x2019; CSI initiatives and hosts the annual Miracle Drive dinner which was held at the Sandton Convention Centre on 21 February 2017.
