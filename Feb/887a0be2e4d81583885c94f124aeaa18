Joanne van der WaltEvery day, across Africa inspiring non-profit leaders, volunteers and their supporters are working to make their communities better places to live. Sage Foundation&#x2019;s Enterprise Fund has been designed to support those organisations generate further income, create new initiatives or enhance existing and proven activity. The $1 million will be split between two rounds of $500,000; with the second round ready for release in July 2017. Applications for the first round are open until April 5. Grants between $5,000 and $35,000 will then be awarded to successful applicants. All applications that fulfil the eligibility criteria will be considered. However, Sage Foundation is especially keen to support organisations that are currently small, but have ambitions to expand, grow and deliver sustainable change. It is also hoped that the fund will support needs such as; capital projects, core running costs or new innovations. &#x201c;Sage Foundation&#x2019;s Enterprise Fund is designed to help organisations generate further income, create new initiatives or enhance existing activity,&#x201d; says Joanne van der Walt, Sage foundation manager, Africa at Sage. &#x201c;There are some wonderful charities across Africa who have innovative, yet practical ideas about how they can solve some of the socio-economic challenges their communities face each day. We want to help them turn these exceptional ideas into reality.&#x201d; Sage Foundation&#x2019;s Enterprise Fund was originally announced at Sage Summit in Chicago in July 2016, part of a series of new initiatives to mobilise Sage colleagues, partners and customers around a common vision for change.
