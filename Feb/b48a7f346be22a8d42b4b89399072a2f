The African Excellence Awards were created to honour the most outstanding achievements of communications and HR professionals in their field. They are part of a worldwide implementation of Excellence Awards, being rolled out in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America simultaneously. Founded in 2007, the European Excellence Awards are the most prestigious awards in the European communications sector. The Excellence Awards are open to public relations, communications, brand building and reputation management professionals from companies, consultancies, associations, institutions, universities and NGOs whose work has displayed exceptional talent and ability. They are hosted by Communication Director, the globally distributed magazine for corporate communications and public relations. With 59 in-depth categories, which cover everything from brand relationship to social media and multi-market communications, the awards explore the full range of the profession, and take a comprehensive look at communications achievements across Africa. The Jury of the African Excellence Awards consists of leading communications and HR professionals from companies, agencies, associations, institutions and universities. They will review all submissions on the following criteria: creativity and innovation, strategy, implementation, results and impact. On 29 June 2017, the winners of the African Excellence Awards will be revealed during a festive event.
