 Javier Tuana 123RF.comWater Affairs department spokesman Sputnik Ratau said the dam that fed Gauteng, parts of North West and Mpumalanga and the Free State was almost full. "This (Sunday) morning the Vaal Dam was at 97.89% and sluice gates have been opened. "They will remain open for at least the next two days," he said. Ratau said the lifting of the water restrictions would be gazetted and would be with immediate effect. Sluice gates have been open since Friday at Bloemhof dam in North West. But, Ratau said, "we are still in a drought", but good rains have had a positive effect on the Vaal integrated river system. Source: The Times
