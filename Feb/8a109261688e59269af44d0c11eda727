Creativity and efficiency are not antithetical. &#x201c;Good and creative media ideas have diverse sources, have widely different budgets and come from all over the world. 2016 has been the year of data, mobile, apps, programmatic advertising, life video, new formats, social media, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and the emoji, all of which enable consumers to experience brands like never before.&#x201d; The Gunn Report Book and Showreel of the Year 2016 DVD will be available in mid-March and will include The Gunn Report for Media 2016. Additionally there will be &#x2018;messages to the industry&#x2019; by guest essayists Mike Cooper, CEO of PHD Worldwide who will share his thoughts on how artificial intelligence will propel media to the forefront of the process; and Nils Andersson, creative president of TBWA\Asia who will address the art and craft of creative in an era of machines.
