South Africans have always loved the Corolla and with the launch of the new model, they are destined to fall in love with it all over again. The commercial shows a driver who just can&#x2019;t contain his love and excitement for his new Corolla. As a result, an imaginary R&B group appear in the backseat and serenade the Corolla with a super catchy love song. Created by Creative Directors Tian Van Den Heever and Simon Fabricius, Copywriter Lazola Gola and Art Director Jacques Moodley following a strategic brief from FCB Joburg&#x2019;s Strategic Director, Kabelo Lehlongwane, the 30-second spot was shot by Bioscope Films in Johannesburg on a four-day shoot. Intended to also reinforce the vehicle&#x2019;s reputation for reliability, dependability and practicality, the ad&#x2019;s prime objectives are to draw awareness to the Toyota Corolla&#x2019;s new design as well as highlight driving enjoyment it delivers. Seamlessly highlighting the vehicle&#x2019;s new features &#x2013; sophisticated design, improved safety and convenience and revised interior styling &#x2013; it targets males between the ages of 35 and 49, and is supported by digital media, social, radio, outdoor, magazine and newspaper executions. &#x201c;The sheer joy and satisfaction of driving a Toyota Corolla are very evident on the driver&#x2019;s face,&#x201d; said Toyota&#x2019;s Senior Manager of Advertising & Digital Marketing, Aidan Castille. &#x201c;He genuinely loves his Toyota, and this makes his heart beat faster. It&#x2019;s a true waku-doki moment for him each time he reaches out to open that driver&#x2019;s door.&#x201d; Credits: Client: Toyota SA Brand: Corolla Senior Manager of Advertising & Digital Marketing: Aidan Castille Brand Manager: Zhandre Brandt Creative agency: FCB Joburg Executive Business Director: Reagen Kok Account Director: Nicole Malan Project Manager: Christine Lubbe Executive Creative Director: Brett Morris Creative Director: Tian Van Den Heever and Simon Fabricius Copywriter: Lazola Gola Art director: Jacques Moodley Strategic planner: Kabelo Lehlongwane TV production: Nakita Bolus Media planners: Sonet Geyer, Whitley Stallbaum and Gwen Bezuidenhout Production companies: Bioscope films, Upstairs Ludas, Frequency sound
