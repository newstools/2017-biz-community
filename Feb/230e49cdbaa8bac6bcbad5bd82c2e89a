With speakers along the likes of rainbow-haired UK colour expert, Kate Moross; Luis von Ahn, the guy who co-invented CAPTCHAs; and Airbnb&#x2019;s co-founder and CPO (that's chief product officer), Joe Gebbia lined up for next week&#x2019;s Design Indaba, there&#x2019;s little wonder why this three-day celebration of all things creative is a must-attend. But those who can&#x2019;t physically (or financially) be in the Artscape&#x2019;s main venue from 1 to 3 March 2017 need not miss out, as various simulcast options have you covered. As this rather bold tweeter put it last year: R7900 for a Design Indaba ticket = most junior designer's salary. R1400 for the simulcast = most junior designer's monthy weed money #cmon&#x2014; fers* (@Fersyndicate) February 17, 2016 Even better news is that while Design Indaba announced no increase in ticket pricing for the second consecutive year, there is a discount if it&#x2019;s a student simulcast ticket you&#x2019;re after (obviously you&#x2019;ll need to produce proof that you&#x2019;re registered with a valid tertiary education institution to qualify), and Cape Town simulcast tickets for non-students are now open. So there&#x2019;s no need to be near Table Mountain to soak up the insights and be dazzled by the creativity on display. The reason? Well, Design Indaba follows a philosophy of accessibility, as they strongly believe that the more people exposed to innovative, creative, out-of-the-box thinking, the more significant the impact of creativity and design to the economy. A scene from the most recent Design Indaba simulcast. This year&#x2019;s simulcast venues include the Artscape and the Labia Theatre in Cape Town itself, as well as Fox Junction in Johannesburg&#x2019;s inner city, Athenaeum's Ford Little Theatre in Port Elizabeth, Durban&#x2019;s International Convention Centre, the Potchefstroom campus of NWU, and even further across the continent at the Franco-Namibian Cultural Centre in Windhoek. In addition, Design Indaba is hosting its first-ever European Simulcast at ECAL in Lausanne, Switzerland so you&#x2019;ll truly be part of a global audience. They say to keep an eye out for global graduate Pauline Saglio, who will be presenting as an alumni of ECAL on the Conference stage. &#x2018;Simulcast&#x2019; doesn&#x2019;t mean an inferior experience, either. What to expect from the Design Indaba simulcast Simply put, the Simulcast is a live screening of the main conference, intended to better distribute the knowledge shared at the main plenary conference, particularly with a younger audience (hello, students, emerging designers and young professionals!) Last year, our editorial assistant Pasqua Heard was one of the masses who attended the Design Indaba simulcast sessions live at the Artscape. Of the experience, she says: &#x201c;Design Indaba Simulcast's intimate setting at the Artscape provided the feeling of being included in the festivities despite not being in the main theatre, because the screenings and sound quality were good and Simulcast attendees were addressed as if they were in the main crowd. You still walk away in awe, having learnt from inspiring speakers and witnessed cutting edge approaches to design.&#x201d; Here&#x2019;s to being dazzled by Design Indaba, wherever you are! As official media partners to the Design Indaba Festival, we&#x2019;ll keep our Design Indaba special section updated throughout the week and beyond, and be sure to get your tickets &#x2013; simulcast or otherwise &#x2013; to experience it for yourself, from http://inda.ba/Fest2017! *Note that Bizcommunity staff and management do not necessarily share the views of the embedded tweet*
