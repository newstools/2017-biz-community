This is the second year that Checkers has supported the station&#x2019;s on-air initiative to provide stationery to schools in and around Stellenbosch, as there is a massive need for stationery every year. The contributors hope this campaign will raise more awareness about the fact that stationery plays a vital role in the motivation of a learner, as it enables them to participate in their daily learning processes without worrying about where their material for schooling will come from. The focus on stationery is part of the station&#x2019;s longer-term approach to improve the education system in South Africa.
