Techsys will create an outcome based strategy which ruthlessly tracks key performance indicators with a focus on consumer acquisition, enrichment and engagement. The project will ensure e-CRM best practise is applied consistently across the business to enhance consumer relationships and in doing so, improve the ROI of digital marketing. The successful implementation will reduce Diageo&#x2019;s reliance on paid media by unlocking the value already available within the consumer database. Using this CRM methodology we are able to deliver quick wins and longer term opportunities within the market in a methodical manner. Andrew Walmsley, Managing Director of Techsys and founder of Brandtribe e-CRM software says: &#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t be happier to partner with Diageo&#x2019;s unrivalled stable of alcohol brands. Their prominence within the SA landscape is immense and we look forward to a partnership underpinned by the desire for excellence within digital marketing communication strategies.&#x201d; Techsys is a full service agency with core competencies in conceiving and executing eCRM strategies through proprietary tools and industry expertise.
