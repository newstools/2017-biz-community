&ldquo;Adding a touch of metallic to your interior d&eacute;cor composition is a great way of making the space in question infinitely more glamorous. However, too much, and the space will look too cold, hard and uninviting. Like most things, incorporating metallic is all about striking the perfect balance.&rdquo; Davidson says lighting is the perfect way of introducing metallics into your d&eacute;cor as they can stand proud as both functional, and aesthetically beautiful statement pieces: &ldquo;Metallic lighting reflect light and many times open up a space, and it almost always gives a dull room a more interesting appeal and unexpected magnetism.&rdquo; She offers her top tips on how to incorporate metallics, without going overboard: 1. The soft touch: mix metallics in with different, softer textures to balance them out. 2. A neutral palette: A neutral monochromatic colour palette will really make the metallic lighting you use stand out. Metallics pair fantastically with darker hues that are so in vogue at the moment, such as grey, black, navy or a variety of deep, rich jewel tones. Alternatively, you can keep the palette light and bright, with a variety of shades of white. 3. Like attracts like: Try and use the same form of metallic throughout, such as brass for example, but mixing it up in various finishes or textures. 4. Start small: It is a better idea to incorporate small doses of metallics into your d&eacute;cor, instead of choosing one large permanent piece that can often be a little overwhelming. Small accent pieces and lighting is a great place to start &ndash; as they are easy to interchange and move around until you find the perfect balance.
