Survey questions focussed on visitor demographics, expenditure patterns, travel motivations and wedding planning behaviour. &#x201c;Most couples are able to spend between R5,000 and R15,000 on their honeymoon, while only 15% of couples surveyed had a budget of between R20,000 and R50,000. Budgets are tight, but respondents are determined to make their rand stretch, and international honeymoon destinations are still the preferred choice. As a result, couples are seeking out value-for-money packages with all inclusive or full board offerings,&#x201d; says Cunningham. Sixty-seven percent of respondents look to international destinations, including islands such as Mauritius and Zanzibar. Italy, Greece, and Paris are the top European destinations. For honeymooners looking at local destinations, Cape Town is a firm favourite. According to The Wedding Expo survey, the top 10 honeymoon destinations for South African couples are: 1. Any island 2. Mauritius 3. Zanzibar 4. Cape Town 5. Italy 6. Anywhere in Europe 7. Greece 8. Paris 9. Thailand 10. Hawaii Cunningham&#x2019;s advice to couples is to carefully compare packages and to pay attention to the best time to travel to their destination, as seasonality impacts prices.
