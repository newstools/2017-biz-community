Throughout the programme, finalists attended a three-day, in-person workshop in Nairobi, Kenya, followed by a six-month online accelerator program that included weekly, in-depth mentoring from Silicon Valley-based executives and local GE business leaders. The program was designed to help the social entrepreneurs acquire business fundamentals, improve their strategic thought processes and articulate a business plan that demonstrates impact, growth and long-term financial sustainability. Building Africa&#x2019;s sustainable future &#x201c;GE believes there is much for social enterprises and large businesses to learn from each other. As the centre of the ecosystem, social entrepreneurs are key to building Africa&#x2019;s sustainable future,&#x201d; said Robert Wells, executive director of healthymagination. &#x201c;The GE and Miller Center collaboration takes an innovative and highly practical approach to combatting this challenge, by providing social entrepreneurs with the skills and resources they need to expand the positive impact of their interventions.&#x201d; The accelerator and mentorship programme culminated in a &#x201c;Premier Pitch&#x201d; event taking place in Nairobi during which the 14 finalists presented their respective enterprises to an audience of potential investors and supporters. Entrepreneurial spirit in Africa &#x201c;We are thrilled to graduate our first cohort of social entrepreneurs. This group of people are helping solve some of Africa&#x2019;s biggest health challenges through their initiatives aimed at improving mother and child care. This is another great example of the strong entrepreneurial spirit in Africa,&#x201d; said Jay Ireland, president and CEO, GE Africa. &#x201c;Addressing the global health challenges of women and children living in sub-standard conditions or facing high-risk pregnancies demands all the determination, diligence and creative solutions we can muster,&#x201d; said Thane Kreiner, Ph.D, executive director of Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship. &#x201c;Now the first cohort of social entrepreneurs is emerging, ready to begin making a tangible difference in maternal and child health by leveraging GE&#x2019;s healthcare expertise and the business-building skills imparted by Miller Center&#x2019;s Silicon Valley mentors.&#x201d; Click here for more information on the programme.
