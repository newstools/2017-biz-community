 Frank Gaertner 123RF.comA reseal of the N4 in Dinokana by Actophambili is already underway. The project has a completion date forecast for May 2017 and a cost budgeted at R34m. Reconstruction work will take place on the N4 between the towns of Zeerust and Lehurutse between February and December 2017. The R95m contract was awarded early in 2017. Between Zeerust and Vaalkop on the N4, another R250m reconstruction contract is estimated to complete during March 2017 with an additional R7.7m for a storm-water upgrade. From Vaalkop to the Groot Marico boundary on the N4, an estimated R273m reconstruction contract will be awarded during July 2017 for an expected duration of 20 months. Between the Groot Marico boundary and Swartruggens a R164m works contract got underway in September 2016, with a completion date scheduled for December 2017. The works are running slightly ahead of schedule and may be complete during November. Plaza expansions The R50m expansion of the plazas at the Brits and Marikana toll plazas was awarded early in 2017, with construction to commence in February and completion estimated by December. A R12m contract for the construction of a third lane at Doornpoort on the N4 East will be awarded early in 2017 with commencement of construction forecast for February 2017. Finally, a R117m reconstruction project on the N1 North between Pumulani and Hammanskraal will also get underway between February and December 2017. Job creation Liam Clarke, commercial manager of Bakwena, says: &#x201c;Bakwena takes pride in ensuring that the 385km it manages under its concession contract are maintained to the highest international standards. The upgrades will enhance the motorists driving experience and reduce delays while improving the overall safety." Clarke says that South Africa&#x2019;s national roads are vital to economic activity, job creation and many social benefits, all of which may suffer unless roads were properly maintained. It is also far cheaper to do regular maintenance than to have to do major repairs following more serious damage. &#x201c;Regular upgrade and maintenance therefore saves the country millions of rands in the long term,&#x201d; concludes Clarke.
