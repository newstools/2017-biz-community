&#x201c;I wanted to create a raw, honest piece that promotes positive body image,&#x201d; says the SAMA-winning music video director, who is up for a Metro FM Award this weekend for his music video for Jump, Anatii&#x2019;s collaboration with Cassper Nyovest and Nasty C. &#x201c;No makeup. No wardrobe. Just a beautiful tapestry of human bodies, of people who share their truths and their vulnerable side, who defy the norms and break the mould. No secrets. No fear.&#x201d; Purity is best known as the vocalist for punk bands Fruits and Veggies and The Pranks. While No Secrets lives up to the hype of the 12-page Rolling Stone spread that kickstarted her career, it&#x2019;s a marked change of pace, showcasing her softer side. &#x201c;Now, all at once, I&#x2019;m starting to make peace with self, and it&#x2019;s been good,&#x201d; she says in the voice-over that starts the video, where she speaks about her new roles as a solo artist and mother. &#x201c;This video embodies everything I believe in and stand for as a woman, as an artist and as an ever-growing entity,&#x201d; says Purity. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a celebration of what true beauty is.&#x201d; Fabian Vettiger shot the music video, which was styled by Kaley Meyer and edited by Stephen du Plessis at 2+3 Post Productions.
