&#x201c;We have been looking for the right talent to add to our Johannesburg roster for nearly two years, so we are super excited to have Zwelethu join us,&#x201d; says Egg Films&#x2019; executive producer, Colin Howard. Zwelethu spent much of his youth behind the lens, recreating his favourite film scenes with nothing but an 8mm camcorder, his BMX and his younger brother as the actor. By the time he was cast as a caricature of cricket legend Lance &#x2018;Zulu&#x2019; Klusener in a washing powder commercial, the film bug had its fangs in deep. Zwelethu finished top of his class throughout film school, winning numerous awards and the bursaries he needed to fund his studies. The trend continued at his first Loeries, where, just months after graduating, he won Silver for Ster-Kinekor Thato in the student category. Still just 27, Zwelethu has spent a busy last three years directing commercials full-time for both local and international agencies and clients, shooting in nine countries across Africa and Europe. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always loved Egg&#x2019;s work and have been inspired by directors like Terence Neale and Sunu,&#x201d; says Zwelethu. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the level of work that I want to do. To be the best, you have to surround yourself in an environment where the best are, so I&#x2019;m looking forward to strengthening my craft here.&#x201d; Expect a cracking start from this Egg.
