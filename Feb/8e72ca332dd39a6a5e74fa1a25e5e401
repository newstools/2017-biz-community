&#x201c;The Stress Index is an effective way of gathering data which has helped us understand the evolving issues facing graduate professionals and provides practical, useful advice to South Africans on how to best approach the prevention and management of this serious health hazard,&#x201d; says Graham Anderson, principal officer and CEO of Profmed. &#x201c;Profmed has chosen to donate to the foundation in light of the drop in the rate of organ transplantation in South Africa over the last few decades. We need a radical overhaul of our system to ensure that more people are willing to donate their organs and that if they do, it is going to the right person,&#x201d; concludes Anderson.
