React and React Native is Facebook&#x2019;s newly released open-source framework which performs on par with any traditional native built app and has only come out of Beta late last year. Other noteworthy features of the Name and Faces app include the use of single codebase for lower cost of ownership, integration with REST API, filtering tools and powerful search functionality which helps organisations build fast directories of their teams. The app also supports multiple accounts and groups, manages and categorises profiles, includes favourite and note keeping functionality and has encryption for added data security. It is safe to say that the new Names and Faces mobile application is the simplest, fastest and most useful people directory ever developed.
