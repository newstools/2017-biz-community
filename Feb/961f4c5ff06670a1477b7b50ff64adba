1. Mosi-oa-Tunya Visitors to Victoria Falls should view the majestic Mosi-oa-Tunya &#x2013; The Smoke That Thunders. This stunning landmark, the world&#x2019;s largest curtain of falling water, is the magnet around which the town of Victoria Falls revolves, and is easily accessible to visitors staying in the area. One can choose to hire a guide for a walk along the trails and through the Rainforest or wander along at one&#x2019;s own pace. There are many viewing areas where one can stop and gaze in awe at this magnificent phenomenon. It is impossible to take a bad photograph of this glorious spot &#x2013; but for a different perspective, book your stay around the full moon, and view the glorious Falls at night and experience the Lunar Rainbow. 2. Sunset cruises Professional, amateur and happy-snap/selfie photographers have amazing photo-opportunities everywhere they look. A chilled sunset cruise on the Zambezi is a must for this. Keep an eye out for wildlife (and birds, including the Fish Eagle) on the riverbank as well as pods of hippo who play hide-and-seek in the water. Remember to pack the binoculars to get a closer look at these creatures in their natural habitat. 3. Delectable cuisine Don&#x2019;t settle for mundane everyday meals during your stay. Sample the local cuisine. If you love your meat, try out the venison (warthog, impala, kudu, ostrich) or take a leap of faith and eat a dried mopane worm (it tastes like charred braai meat!) &#x2013; be sure to claim your certificate to prove your bravery! Embrace the entire foodie adventure and book The Boma &#x2013; Dinner & Drum Show. Diners are draped in a &#x201c;chitenge&#x201d; on arrival, and can have their hair braided and face painted during the evening. The food shares the spotlight with the bone-thrower telling fortunes, traditional dancers and a rousing interactive drumming experience which ends the evening on a high note. The show is only a short shuttle-drive away from the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge, Victoria Falls Safari Club or Victoria Falls Safari Suites &#x2013; all properties in the Africa Albida Tourism (AAT) portfolio. Guests staying at Victoria Falls Safari Lodge can tell the time by looking at the sky and watching out for circling vultures just before 1pm every day. Hundreds of these birds of prey swoop down at this time and feast on leftover scraps of meat and bones from the on-site restaurants. Guests may view this activity in close proximity from the Vulture Culture viewing deck. The Vulture Culture Experience is free, and a unique opportunity to learn more about these endangered raptors. Now and again one may even spot a warthog &#x2013; masquerading as a vulture &#x2013; foraging amidst the feeding frenzy. 4. Activity-laden destination Victoria Falls is synonymous with adrenalin-inducing activities &#x2013; and many tourists visit the area to participate in anything from white water-rafting down the rapids, hovering above the Falls in a helicopter or stepping into thin air on a Gorge Swing or Zip Line. Having a comfortable base after a strenuous day of bucket-listing is a must. Luxurious accommodation at AAT&#x2019;s properties in Victoria Falls is available to honeymooners, groups of friends, girls&#x2019; or boys&#x2019; weekends or family adventures.
