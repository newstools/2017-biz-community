Sean Holmes, marketing director at Primi comments, &#x201c;Consumers nowadays want to interact and engage in real time and the gaming platform enables us to facilitate this interaction in-store at table level. Not only can we interact this way via the consumer&#x2019;s mobile device in a fun way, but we can also reward the consumer in real time. This is a voucher or coupon, which in turn will be received by the customer whilst at the table, enabling it to be redeemed instantly.&#x201d; New identity, traditional recipes Primi also recently underwent a revitalising exercise, including a name and logo change, the introduction of a new menu and more. This also included a new state-of-the-art pizza oven imported from Italy, which combines traditional wood-fired baking with innovative gas-burner technology. "The result is an oven than that reaches up to 450 degrees Celsius and a perfectly baked pizza," says the franchise. With the redesign of the restaurant, each store also creates its own visual identity, including graffiti art, which embraces its local context and the personality of the restaurateur. Hughes states, &#x201c;After 18 years, the brand is as strong as ever and this success can be attributed to ongoing innovation, adaptability and passion &#x2013; passion for food and for people. &#x201c;As with the life cycle of all brands, innovation and creative thinking is key, in order to shift the curve and maintain relevance in an ever-evolving consumer driven market. Technology has enabled and expedited the implementation of global trends across multiple markets and regions, creating a far more competitive landscape. Brands are not only compared with their local counterparts but also on a global scale. Given the seamless flow of information available, there really is no excuse not to keep abreast with international trends.&#x201d;
