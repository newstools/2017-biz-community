I recently watched an emotional piece of work by Mullen Lowe SSP3 Bogot /Mullen Lowe Lintas Mumbai for their client, Unilever Global Lifebuoy, which took home a Wood Pencil at this year&#x2019;s D&AD Awards. Titled "Chamki: The girl from the future", it was the most watched piece of content across India last year, though it served as a real-life experiment over a big-budget scripted film. In it, we see a production team travelling to a small rural village in India. It&#x2019;s a village of fear as millions of children die before the age of five each year, based on preventable infections like pneumonia and diarrhoea. There, they find an expectant mother, Sangrahi. They then chatted to her friends and family about what the baby she&#x2019;s expecting will look like, find a real girl who matches those characteristics, and surprise Sangrahi and the rest of the village with a video message from her &#x2018;unborn baby&#x2019; Chamki. In it, she offers a simple message of thanks to Sangrahi for frequently washing her hands and thus keeping her infection-free. It&#x2019;s hard to watch that and not get choked up &#x2013; and you&#x2019;re bound to see Lifebuoy in a more positive light as a result. I mulled over why this specific piece of content resonated with me so &#x2013; perhaps D&AD CEO Tim Lindsay himself put it best: great creative advertising talent can solve many of the world&#x2019;s problems. So, at the end of the day, it&#x2019;s about being in business for good, for a higher cause, and making the world a better place. That&#x2019;s when I had the lightbulb moment: "Chamki: The girl from the future" hit home because it has marked similarities with many of the shows we work on, such as Airtel&#x2019;s Touching Lives in Nigeria. It takes consumers on an emotional ride, presented in talk-show format with real-life interviews. Click through to watch Ania&#x2019;s story, for example, to see how she lost three of her four children in a fire tragedy. More than lip service: Brands resonating with purpose Up until October last year the Aina family were flourishing. Olusegun Aina worked as a carpenter providing for his wife and four children, including their three-year-old twins. But all that changed in an instant when tragedy struck their home in the Magoro community of Ogun State. On Tuesday, 11 October 2016, the Aina family from Ogun State suffered more tragedy than any one family should experience. An explosion inside their house caused by spilt fuel from the generator engulfed their home in flames. Mr and Mrs Aina tried their best to save their four children, but the smoke and heat was too much and their twins perished in the fire. The family was rushed to hospital and were treated for third-degree burns. Due to the severity of his burn wounds, the eldest boy, Iyanu (8) succumbed to his injuries a week later. Only young Korede (6) survived, together with his mother and father. They have mounting hospital bills, and no home to go back to. All of Mr Aina&#x2019;s tools he uses as a carpenter have been destroyed. Airtel Touching Lives changed their lives for the better &#x2013; much-needed repair to their home as well as assisting in any outstanding medical bills. So Airtel&#x2019;s support didn&#x2019;t just touch their lives, it actually uplifted and saved them from what was described &#x201c;a living hell&#x201d;. It also shows Airtel is a caring brand without a corny voice-over announcing "Airtel is a caring brand". It&#x2019;s something you feel, a message that resonates and stays with you. It&#x2019;s an emotional connection created by the action in the show. Watch her story at http://airteltouchinglives.com/airtel-touching-lives-season-3-episode-1-s03e01/. Four elements of emotional branded content Community-driven content: Community involvement is the central concept for Airtel&#x2019;s Touching Lives. Ordinary Nigerians are singled out to financially reward remarkable citizens making a difference to other people&#x2019;s lives. This in turn creates a big drive in those communities to discover local heroes who are caring for and uplifting others, with the call-to-entry alone yielding thousands upon thousands of stories of people who were making a difference to local communities. Storied content: From those thousands of entries, Launch Factory sifts through the content for the most worthy contributions. This is judged on social appeal, brand fit and television content. The 13 episodes or stories we filmed were significant as they were all self-contained, very emotional, and placed both the brand and the local hero as the stars of a heartwarming story with a feel-good ending. And while it&#x2019;s best for your storied content to be community-based, remember that the emotional aspect is universal. Compelling human content: People across the globe are inspired, motivated and deeply touched by stories of other human beings who triumph against all odds. That&#x2019;s why "Chamki: The girl from the future" hit home with D&AD&#x2019;s global judges, and that&#x2019;s the basis of the stories that we told in Airtel's Touching Lives &#x2013; the remarkable local narratives of people who refused to give up. Socially uplifting content: Lastly what made the difference to Airtel&#x2019;s branded content was that it was more than branded entertainment. The mobile company has made significant financial investments to improve the lot of those featured in the series, and by rewarding those local heroes, Airtel in turn rewarded the communities they served. Going beyond merely branding the content, the series made a positive and sustainable contribution to both local development and social upliftment. </li></li></li>Keep in mind these aren&#x2019;t necessarily stand-alone factors, as the best emotional content weaves in aspects of all the above elements. Don&#x2019;t forget the power in broadcasting the show, either. We&#x2019;ve done so across a number of Nigerian TV stations, as TV is still a very powerful medium. But the story doesn&#x2019;t end there: as Africa is undoubtedly mobile-first, the content is also repurposed for web and mobile, making it as accessible as possible. What are you waiting for?
