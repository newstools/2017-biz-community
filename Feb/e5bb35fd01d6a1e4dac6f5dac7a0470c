The Grainfather is a New Zealand-based business that delivers innovative brew kits and systems to craft beer connoisseurs. Their expert team of industrial designers, engineers, and brewers launched their all-in-one brewing system through an e-commerce platform in August 2014, taking the best brewing practices from craft breweries, and putting them into a simple to use, all in one system, to ensure anyone anywhere could brew a professional craft beer, no matter their brewing experience. When DigitLab first entered into a relationship with The Grainfather, their site had limited functionalities that were holding the business back from living up to its full potential. Working closely with The Grainfather we created and crafted an e-commerce website that stayed true to the brand&#x2019;s artisan heritage. We created a clean design with a strong focus on providing great user experience, and a &#x2018;handcrafted&#x2019; experience built specifically to cater to avid brewers and beer lovers. The new e-commerce site led to sales dramatically increasing to R1,389,105.40 in just one month. The ROI was three-fold, with The Grainfather making the cost of the website development back more than three times over. A month after launch, visits to the new site increased by 87%, and page views increased by 121%. Most importantly, The Grainfather website now offers a world-class e-commerce experience for its customers, with seamless integrations and flawless functionality. The IAB Bookmark Award&#x2019;s ninth year promises to be one of the biggest industry celebrations, and we are proud to have made it this far. We wish our fantastic clients, The Grainfather, all the best and look forward to finding out who the winners of the IAB Bookmark Awards 2017 will be.
