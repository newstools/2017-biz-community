 Cory Thoman 123RF.comNow in its 6th year, the Mzansi Spelling Bee challenge was created to enhance and encourage young South Africans to work within their communities to cultivate a culture of reading and spelling. The winner of the 2017 Mzansi Spelling Bee will represent South Africa at the 2018 Africa Spelling Bee and walk away with over R10,000 in gifts and prizes. Endorsed by the Department of Basic Education, the programme has been developed to speak to children by combining learning and playing. The programme will be going around to school&#x2019;s country wide engaging spellers to take part in this year&#x2019;s challenge. One Word, a coming of age theatre production on the Spelling Bee and movie screenings in local community halls and schools will be used to inspire and motivate spellers to take the challenge to be Mzansi&#x2019;s next speller.
