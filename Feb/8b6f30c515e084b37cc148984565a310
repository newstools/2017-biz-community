In addition, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) &#x2013; which enables the edge of the network to run in an isolated environment from the rest of the network and creates access to local resources and data &#x2013; is looming, with Research and Markets pegging it as an over $80 billion market opportunity by 20212. &#x201c;Services will be both centralised and distributed,&#x201d; Walshaw explained. &#x201c;This means technology that can apply functionality independent of underlying protocols will become a strategic must-have. This will give service providers the flexibility to apply services anywhere in the network.&#x201d; The shift is likely to drive demand for emerging solutions such as Intelligent Traffic Steering/Management, service function-chaining and TCP optimisation, which run at different points in the network, ideally as close to the end-user as possible. &#x201c;These solutions could become hierarchical and distributed where different proxies talk to each other, creating a sort of &#x2018;reliable&#x2019; point-to-point intermediate connections to enable faster retransmission in case of any network drop, wherever it happens,&#x201d; said Walshaw. Another important part of the 5G puzzle is Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), with networks straining to scale to accommodate massive data usage. Ericsson&#x2019;s Mobility Report predicts that mobile video traffic alone is expected to increase by about 50% annually through 2022 to account for nearly 75% of all mobile data traffic. Social networking will be the second-biggest data traffic type, forecast to grow by 39% annually in the coming six years. &#x201c;Making a business more virtual requires a greater focus on cloud-based technologies and solutions,&#x201d; added Walshaw. &#x201c;NFV architectures provide the necessary network flexibility to enable new service delivery models and elastic network scaling to reduce total cost of ownership. The orchestration of networks, whether a fully virtualised network or a hybrid, lets you dynamically instantiate new services and deliver a network that can provide subscribers with more personalised service as well as an improved quality of experience.&#x201d;
