This coveted stamp of approval comes in the form of the MamaMagic New Product Awards. Exhibition Director, Warren Murray elaborates: &#x201c;Our primary reason for starting the New Product Awards was to create a platform that would highlight new and innovative products that are launched within the industry, establishing a footstool in the world of parenting.&#x201d; With so many new products and services continually entering the market, MamaMagic has instilled a thorough adjudication system. The very best experts and media gurus in the pregnancy, baby, toddler and parenting categories have been selected who take some of the following criteria into consideration: practicality, ease of use, overall visual impact, value for money, innovation in the market and more. Along with the criteria, there are a number of categories that adjudicators need to consider. The New Product Award categories include Baby Essentials, Feeding, Mom&#x2019;s Essentials, Nursery Products, Play, Safety, Travel, Local is Lekker, Green Product and Parents&#x2019; Choice. In true South African style, the Local is Lekker award and Green categories themselves inspire out-of-the-box thinking. The Green category celebrates non-toxic, organic products that remain non-harmful to the environment. Local is Lekker speaks for itself&#x2026; innovative brands developed locally that support local entrepreneurs, hence the growth of our local economy. It's not just the experts who have a say: MamaMagic recognises that the end users, parents, are in fact not only the consumers but also judges of all products in their own right. The Parents Choice Awards are products most loved by the MamaMagic parents. Simultaneously, parents get to select their ultimate product across all categories. This process is an electronic one implemented via a newsletter that is distributed to the entire MamaMagic database. Every parent has the chance to have his or her say and to experience what&#x2019;s new in the market. Murray further explains that the New Product Awards &#x201c;not only helps businesses and brands grow but offers a place for parents to find and experience products which will offer them convenience along their parenting journey."
