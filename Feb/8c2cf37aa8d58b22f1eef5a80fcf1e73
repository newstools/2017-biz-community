Emma Winchurch-BealeOne of her first moves in this role is announcing the deadline extension for the World Media Awards (WMAs) to Thursday 23 February, so candidates have an extra week to submit their entry. The WMAs are the only awards to celebrate the effectiveness of cross platform, cross border, content-driven advertising and the organisers are very keen to see more entries from Africa and the Middle East this year. The awards are open to anyone involved in creating bold, creative strategies that engage with international, influential audiences - from advertisers to media agencies, creative agencies and PR agencies, along with publisher brands for the entertainment & media category. Entry is free and category winners will see their work celebrated in an advertising campaign valued at &#x20ac;500K, running across the World Media Group&#x2019;s leading international media brands. Winchurch-Beale comments, &#x201c;As the World Media Awards enter their second year, bigger and better than before, this is an exciting time to be group president. In 2017, it is important for the industry to understand the great richness and quality of today&#x2019;s branded content and the huge value it can create for brands. We hope that the awards will provide inspiration to others and a benchmark for what international branded content should achieve - hence why we are offering one more week for people to enter the awards and show off their great content-driven campaigns.&#x201d; For more information, go to www.wm-awards.com.
