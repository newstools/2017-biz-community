Since 2004, Times Media has commissioned HDI Youth Marketeers to conduct the survey, which polls youths across more than 70 categories, to quantify their perception of brands, products and celebrities. Catherine Bothma, MD of HDI Youth Marketeers, explains the rationale for the new additions. &#x201c;We have had requests from brands and corporates to expand the survey categories in 2017, which bears testimony to the value marketers place on the data delivered. We have also revised categories to ensure more of a like-for-like evaluation, which is why we've separated universities and colleges into categories of their own in this year's survey." Conference enters third year The Sunday Times Generation Next Youth Marketing Conference and Interactive Showcase also celebrate their third year, as anticipated additions to the awards event, where the results of the survey are announced. In 2016, the conference drew 320 top-level delegates from the marketing and advertising sector. It will take place at the Sandton Convention Centre on 11 May 2017. The Interactive Showcase - where brands allow the youth to experience their products in creative and captivating displays - saw exhibitor numbers increase to more than twenty, and included brands such as Dark & Lovely, MNet Movies, Converse, Super C, Boston College, Bakers, Lucky Star, SABC1, VW, Lumi, Pringles, Eucerin, You Decide, Proudly SA, Sunday Times, Disney, Deal Hound and BOUNCE. Confirmed 2017 partnerships include Adidas, BOUNCE and Maybelline. &#x201c;The Sunday Times Generation Next survey delivers exceptional research on the brand preferences of today&#x2019;s youth and tomorrow&#x2019;s consumers. It represents an ideal opportunity for marketers to gauge their brand initiatives and action changes to keep their competitors on their toes,&#x201d; says Taryn Westoby, head of Times Media Events. &#x201c;Times Media remains committed to answering the need for solid market intelligence, in order to support the brand ambitions of advertisers.&#x201d; In 2016, Sunday Times Generation Next generated in excess of R3.5m in media coverage across print, broadcast and digital platforms. &#x201c;The opportunity for brands to benefit through association with the Sunday Times Generation Next movement is great,&#x201d; concludes Westoby.
