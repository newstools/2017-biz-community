Do you sit in traffic and wonder WTF is dark traffic and why does it matter so much? Then you ponder why are you even sitting in traffic when everything seems to be happening in the digital space? Am I becoming fragmented like data lost in space, you may ask yourself? Next, oh-my-word, come the heart palpitations, brought on by negative thoughts that you are totally going from first place to last. From prologue to footnote &#x2013; it&#x2019;s that sad. And then, &#x201c;Whaam!&#x201d; it hits you like a Roy Lichtenstein artwork, &#x201c;I need help or else I&#x2019;ll get lost and left behind in the [drum roll and deep voice here] New Marketing World&#x201d;. Racing along like an emergency ambulance to resuscitate you is Madex 2017. It is South Africa&#x2019;s, nay, Africa&#x2019;s, very first event focusing purely on marketing (see event details at end). Two excellent seminar theatres boast more than 20 free lectures to help you get to grips with terminology such as &#x201c;an influencer marketing campaign&#x201d;, &#x201c;chatbots&#x201d;, &#x201c;short-lived content&#x201d;, &#x201c;virtual and augmented reality&#x201d;, &#x201c;mobile marketing strategy&#x201d;, &#x201c;artificial intelligence&#x201d;, &#x201c;infobesity&#x201d;, &#x201c;niche curation&#x201d;, &#x201c;e-mail marketing&#x201d;, &#x201c;effective measurement&#x201d;, the list goes on. These trends are influencing your job and you need to be a step ahead to ensure your survival. It&#x2019;s gripping stuff brought to you by gurus in the know. Do not miss out, as it&#x2019;s first come first seated. The seminar programme can be viewed here. It&#x2019;s split into &#x201c;The Fundamentals&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Academy&#x201d;, the former covering all the basics, with the latter delving deeper into trends. Keynote speakers include John Vlismas, Femi Abedanji, Grant Lottering, Brent Lindeque, Samke Ngwenya and Eric Vermeulen. The value adding Cinema Theatre provides addition visual insight and is inspired by local advertising campaigns. &#x201c;The scenario today in marketing is the same as in any other industry. You need to adapt to the marketing disruption or risk being left behind. We created Madex as we saw a dire need for information to get up to speed with what is happening in this industry and alleviate the fear of redundancy. Traditional marketing is failing. It&#x2019;s fact. And so, skillsets need to be retaught and rethought. Above all, awareness needs to be created that, sadly, yes, you are being left behind and you do not even know it,&#x201d; adds says Nick Sarnadas, event director: Madex 2017, Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery.
