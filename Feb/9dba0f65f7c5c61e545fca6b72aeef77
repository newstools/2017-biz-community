For marketers, it&#x2019;s about fulfilling far-fetched ideas and creating experiences not otherwise possible, while putting the brand at centre stage, of course. &#x201c;The tech has become a big part of brand activations by innovative companies, providing a one to two minute experience, with an abundance of information presented in a cool way. From generating excitement about the brand to introducing a product or tool by showcasing its many uses and benefits, VR is fundamentally changing what is possible in marketing. We have seen consumers become so excited they have asked to re-experience the VR. &#x201c;New developments in the space are under way, leading to an exciting future. Expressly human action is enticed by audio and visual cues. However, to achieve immersion, the other senses must be satisfied. VR app developers are experimenting with haptic feedback, using gloves and handheld controls and 2017 will see more time and resources invested into developing inputs for touch and smell. &#x201c;As an agency with a strong belief in a meaningful user experience, we optimise consumer brand beliefs through VR. Why watch a sports car race around a track when you can be fully immersed in one? We've been receiving an increasing number of requests for VR solutions as more companies are seeing the possibilities for their brand. &#x201c;Branded headsets have become more affordable, VR apps are evolving, and the priceless look on consumers' faces when they are in the VR environment is worth the investment. VR plays its part well in brand awareness and I&#x2019;m very excited about the new technological possibilities in the near future.&#x201d;
