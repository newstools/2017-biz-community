Accounting for only 3% of the world&#x2019;s air traffic, Africa portrays massive potential for growth in the coming years, especially due to the increasing demand from the rising middle class and the growing African economies. &#x201c;Jumia Travel aims at capitalising on a market that is progressively driving hospitality demand on the continent. With the International Air Transport Association, (IATA) predicting a strong growth of 4.8% in passenger numbers in Africa in the next five years, this confirms our strategic commitment to provide infinite travel solutions to travellers,&#x201c; added Midy.
