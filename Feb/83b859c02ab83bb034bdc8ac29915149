What do you do when you see people suffering because of a lack of infrastructure? Do you shake your head in sorrow as you walk away and comfort yourself however you choose to or, do you brave the emotions and become a part of the solution? For Grey Design, a local advertising and design company, the answer was obviously the latter. In South Africa&#x2019;s dense, growing metropolitan areas, thousands of people do not have visible house numbers. This is not just an inconvenience, it&#x2019;s a life and death situation as it means that emergency services cannot always reach people in time. Introducing Satellife: a simple, life-saving solution which employs the use of effective visual design to aid residents who encounter medical and other emergencies. Satellife employs the use of creatively designed, multi-coloured vinyls which are stuck onto satellite dishes and mounted onto houses, allowing paramedics and other emergency professionals to easily locate house numbers in the event of a crisis. The project is a pilot project in which 10 houses were chosen and given clearly marked house numbers. If successful, Grey Design will approach local municipalities across the country with intent to roll-out Satellife nationally. Activations company Loxyion Connexion is Grey Design&#x2019;s Satellife partner. &#x201c;We would never have been able to get the project off the ground if it wasn&#x2019;t for Loxyion Connextion, as they have deep connections and relationships in Soweto. They approached all the homeowners on our behalf to get permission and buy-in,&#x201d; said Fran Luckin, Chief Creative Officer at Grey Design. &#x201c;The plight of these residents isn&#x2019;t heard of in suburban South Africa so our mandate is two-fold: provide a solution to this very real problem as well as create awareness of this issue. Kliptown was specifically chosen as the houses are close together and it&#x2019;s difficult to see the house numbers &#x2013; which makes it perfect for what we want to do,&#x201d; she said. A local Kliptown resident told of how her daughter fell gravely ill in which sadly, ended in a fatal casualty due to an ambulance having taken over three hours to arrive. &#x201c;I hope to see that other residents won&#x2019;t have to face the heartache I live with every day because of this clever idea,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a great time to be working in emergency service assistance,&#x201d; said Connor Hartnady, Emergency Care Practitioner and Lecturer at Department of Medical Care at the University of Johannesburg. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lost track of the incidents we&#x2019;ve had to gravely deal with due to paramedics being unable to locate distressed houses. Satellife is going to help us save many lives,&#x201d; he said.
