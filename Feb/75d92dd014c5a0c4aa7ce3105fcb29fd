&#x201c;There are the oversized sunglasses, big boots, big shoulders, exaggerated and unusual silhouettes, bold colours and loud prints,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the return of maximalism and the season&#x2019;s giving a big head&#x2019;s up to Alessandro Michele, creative director at Gucci who has been hailed as &#x2018;the movement&#x2019;s spiritual leader&#x2019;.&#x201d; This is all good and well, but why are we being big and bold during these tough times? May says that it is a reflection of how we&#x2019;re feeling &#x2013; strong, confident and powerful. &#x201c;The expression of confidence is in defiance of holding back, and of keeping ideas to ourselves and our mouths shut,&#x201d; she explains. &#x201c;One of the hottest fashion trends we will be seeing this winter is the hiking and/or the biker boot being worn with fishnet stockings and pretty winter dresses. The hiking boot is a show of strength and health, and a &#x2018;don&#x2019;t mess with me&#x2019; attitude.&#x201d; Biggest beauty trend this season May says that glitter make-up will be the trend &#x2013; with a strong reference to the 80s, glitter will brighten all our days. She adds: &#x201c;Bold lipsticks will also be popular. Times are still tough in South Africa. And although we&#x2019;ll be buying a few of the new trends to update our wardrobes, the bold lipstick colours will, and can, update all looks &#x2013; at very little cost.&#x201d; May says the Marie Claire team forecasts fashion and beauty trends by watching and reading everything they can about what designers present at fashion shows around the world. She continues: &#x201c;I read reports on fashion shows and especially love Vanessa Friedman and Lisa Armstrong. I watch the fashion shows &#x2013; the international ones are live-streamed, thankfully &#x2013; and the local ones are always fun to attend. &#x201c;Instagram is a great tool for finding out what influencers wear and what is being worn on the street. Following creative campaigns and reading international magazines (both old and new) are important too, as they help inspire ways in which we will interpret trends, taking into account where our readers buy clothes and how they wear clothes. In other words, we have to interpret trends for South African readers. &#x201c;As a team we collate the big trends of the season, which we analyse and present to our readers on our beautiful fashion pages throughout the year.&#x201d; She says that if you&#x2019;re watching all the shows and reading what commentators say about them, you pick up the common threads quite easily. The designers are, in turn, responding and commenting on their cultural and social environments. May says that what&#x2019;s happening in American politics is having a big impact on fashion and that we&#x2019;ll be seeing that in our spring-summer trends. &#x201c;The current autumn and winter trends are a reaction, you could say, to too many years of recession and of holding back. Fashion makes a fun &#x2013; but relevant comment on our times.&#x201d; The March issue of Marie Claire provides a full A-Z trend report on Autumn/Winter 2017. @marieclaire_sa on Twitter | @Marieclairesa on Instagram | Marie Claire on Facebook
