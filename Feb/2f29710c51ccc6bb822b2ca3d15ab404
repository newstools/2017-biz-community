Wesgro CEO Tim Harris said, &#x201c;The increase in connectivity to the rest of Africa helps to strengthen trade, investment and tourism ties to key partners on the continent.&#x201d; &#x201c;We have seen increased demand for Cape Town and had to increase our frequency in December. The route via Victoria Falls offers our guests two leisure holiday options,&#x201d; added Kenya Airways MD and CEO Mbuvi Ngunze. &#x201c;The addition of this new route is excellent news for improving access for strategic markets to travel to our destination. In the Western Cape, we have prioritised tourism through our Project Khulisa growth strategy. It is our goal to add up to 120,000 additional jobs to the Cape's tourism sector, and we believe that Cape Town Air Access has a crucial role to play in helping us reach this goal,&#x201d; concluded Western Cape Minster of Economic Opportunities Alan Winde. Cape Town Air Access is a Wesgro-led collaboration between the Western Cape Government, the City of Cape Town, the Airports Company of South Africa and Cape Town Tourism to improve air connectivity in the Cape.
