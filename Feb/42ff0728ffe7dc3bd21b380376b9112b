 Peter Titmuss via 123RFThe State of the Global Islamic Economy 2014-2015 report estimated that 117 million Muslim tourists travelled during 2015 (close to 10% of the total travel population), with the number estimated to grow to 168 million by 2020, with travel expenditure expected to reach $200 billion. Of the six aforementioned GCC states, the UAE had the highest number of arrivals in the Western Cape, with a total of 272,290 flight seats booked for 2015. This was 30.5% increase from 2012, with a year on year growth of 2.5% in 2012, 6.6% 2013 and a double-digit growth for the 2014-2015 period. Doha, Qatar had the least flights coming into the Western Cape in 2015 but these numbers are sure to have grown last year as Cape Town is becoming a recognised Halaal tourism destination. And although South Africa is considered a non&#x2013;organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) destination, Cape Town is one of Africa's leading Halaal tourism destinations and the 2015 MasterCard-Crescent Rating Muslim Travel Shopping Index's OIC's ninth best non-IOC destination. Tapping into the Muslim travel market &#x201c;Through our Project Khulisa growth strategy, we are seeking to boost tourism to the Western Cape, and we have identified the Gulf Co-operation Council states as important target markets. At present, the global Muslim population stands at 1.6 billion, with around 60% being under 30. This vibrant, family-orientated market has radically increased its tourism spend in recent years. We are well-positioned to increase our share of that market due to the strong cultural similarities between our regions. A recent report suggests that the global Muslim Tourism Market is already worth an estimated $151 billion. This partnership with dnata World Travel will play a vital role in our Project Khulisa plan to promote our destination more actively in the GCC states to secure more of this business.&#x201d; With all this momentum, we look forward to working with dnata World Travel to make the Cape a more enticing Halaal tourism destination.
