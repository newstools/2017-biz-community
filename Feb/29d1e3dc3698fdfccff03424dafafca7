Zubair Noor While tricky to get right, personalised marketing is essential if you want your business to stand out, because customers expect brands to empathise with their needs and address them accordingly. Your aim is to provide a &#x201c;content-rich and and relevant experience&#x201d;, both on your website and in-store. This is achieved by targeted and tailored messaging to the right people based on factors including their age, gender and interests. Be specific about what the customer can expect from your site or store with relation to quality of customer service, delivery times, and the like. Discussing the benefits, Noor says, &#x201c;Marketing personalisation allows you to target users along each stage of the purchasing funnel or buying cycle and allows you to then guide those users along the funnel to your final end goal, whether it is a sale, conversion or signup...This helps you control when and where the message is sent to the user. It allows you to breach the gap between yourself (the advertiser) and the customer by adding a personal touch to what normally would be an impersonal process.&#x201d; Customer research is key Be prepared to set a budget for marketing personalisation, as this can be costly - especially when gaining customer insights. Conduct customer research through surveys, user behaviour and your sales team, then group your customers into segments based on their interests shown in how they navigate your website and which departments they view. &#x201c;This is one of the most important things with regard to personalised marketing,&#x201d; says Noor, &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t have reliable data to base your targeting and segmentation on, you&#x2019;re just going to waste money and make incorrect decisions.&#x201d; Useful channels to reach your users Noor explained the benefit of using a variety of channels to reach customers, dependent on one&#x2019;s offering. He referred to the Forbes Insights and PwC Content Survey, Leading with customer-focused content: driving growth through personalized experiences, to indicate the most effective channels to engage customers with personalised content. He placed particular emphasis on paid media, saying, &#x201c;From a digital perspective, paid media is one of the most powerful tools you can use for marketing personalisation, because Google and Facebook lock their customers into their ecosystems and, in that way, they can learn more about their customers and their interests.&#x201d; Noor also explained the benefits of using the following channels for your personalised marketing efforts: Digital Remarketing. This refers to the process when someone views a few products on your site, but then switches to another site where the products will reappear. Noor warns that remarketing needs to be relevant to the customer and cannot be too repetitive or persistent. Signup email. &#x201c;If you have your analytics tools integrated, you can assess customer information based on insights from their behaviour on your site, so you know what kind of products that customers buys and can cross-sell certain products in the same genre to that person through email. You can also email to thank someone after signing up. For example, &#x201c;Hi, thanks for signing up. This is what you can expect of our service in future.&#x201d; Transaction email. Following up post purchase to thank the customer and let him/her know when the order will be delivered. Abandoned cart. This refers to reminding someone when they have selected an item, but have not yet checked out. Noor explained that it can be a helpful moment to connect with the customer who may have forgotten about their items in the cart. Organic search.
