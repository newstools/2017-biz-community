The 787-10, built exclusively at Boeing South Carolina, will now be prepared for its first flight in the coming weeks. &#x201c;This aeroplane, the most efficient in its class, is the result of years of hard work and dedication from our Boeing teammates, suppliers and community partners in South Carolina and across the globe,&#x201d; said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO. &#x201c;We know our customers, including launch customer Singapore Airlines, are going to love what the 787-10 will do for their fleets, and we can&#x2019;t wait to see them fly it.&#x201d; Boeing will deliver the 787-10 to airlines in 2018. The aeroplane has won 149 orders from nine customers across the globe. Up to 10% better fuel use The 787-10, the longest model of the Dreamliner family, will grow the nonstop routes opened by the 787-8 and 787-9 with unprecedented efficiency. As an 18-foot (5.5-m) stretch of the 787-9, the 787-10 will deliver the 787 family&#x2019;s preferred passenger experience and long range with up to 10% better fuel use and emissions than the competition. The 787 Dreamliner family is a key part of Boeing&#x2019;s twin-aisle strategy, which offers a modern, optimised and efficient aeroplane family in every market segment. Since entering service in 2011, the 787 family has flown more than 140 million people on 530 routes around the world, saving an estimated 13 billion pounds of fuel.
