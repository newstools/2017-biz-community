&#x201c;I took up the challenge to work closely with Zali, the Key Account Manager for KFC at Mindshare, to get this project up and running. The duration of the campaign was for four months and the aim was to create a hype around KFC Mini Cricket (and the brand overall) to let consumers know that it&#x2019;s a friendly and fun venture for kids to join. We both were quite pleased with the lead time and implementation of 1200 umbrellas which only took a few weeks to deliver,&#x201d; says Angelique, Senior Sales Executive at Tractor Outdoor. The campaign was a tremendous success and took KFC&#x2019;s branding to a whole new level, with umbrellas scattered along popular beaches such as Camps Bay, Gordon&#x2019;s Bay, Clifton, Ballito and Margate. With summer peaking around the holiday season, Cape Town and KwaZulu-Natal beaches were swarming with tourists and locals alike once again this year and the rental of KFC&#x2019;s umbrellas seemed to keep people cool and out of the sun. Beach media also provides additional employment to previously disadvantaged individuals who were given the opportunity of earning an income from the rental of the umbrellas.
