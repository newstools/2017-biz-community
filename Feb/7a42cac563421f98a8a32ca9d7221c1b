The partnership will see Tracker work hand in hand with Imperial&#x2019;s fleet management department to achieve new fleet management efficiencies and create new value for Imperial and its customers. Wynand Pretorius, executive: Special Projects at Imperial Car Rental said, "The inclusion of telematics technology across our fleet will address a number of business objectives. The primary focus of the project is the safety and security of our customers and we will now be able to dispatch emergency services under predetermined conditions without the customer needing to initiate contact." &#x201c;Our secondary objective is to realise internal benefits such as improved operational efficiencies, better theft recovery ratios and geospatial analysis for enhanced fleet management. The roll-out of telemetry devices should ultimately improve our quality and service delivery to the market,&#x201d; he said.
